The `ext` directory is currently intended for modules that are:

+ Written in Perl6
+ Are completed works
+ Pass all tests

These modules will be built, tested and installed from the top level
Pugs installation commands. They will be installed as Perl6 modules in
the Perl6 lib directories.

These modules are not intended to be /core/ modules. They are just
examples of Perl6 modules that work. `Test.pm` is currently used in the
Pugs build system but this does not mean it is a core module. The hope
is there that is no concept of core modules in Perl6.
