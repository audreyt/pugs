At this moment, there are two source trees in this project:

 * lib-kp6-mp6: This is the version that uses the mp6 compiler for  
    some files and that mixes kp6 and mp6 runtime.

 * lib-kp6-kp6: This is a pure-kp6 version of the above tree. Some
    changes are currently need so kp6 can be compiled by itself,
    this changes are basically in the runtime and are documented
    in the doc/KP6_Bootstrap_Notes.txt file.

Both these directories are compiled to plain-p5 files in a directory
with a "-p5" added in the end. At this moment the only compiler that
really works is kp6-mp6-perl5.pl.

When the bootstrap finishes, we'll be able to simplify this structure
to a simple "lib" and "lib5" again.


==================================


The differences between lib-kp6-mp6 and lib-kp6-kp6 currently are:

* KindaPerl6::Runtime::Perl5::Grammar
  was moved to
  KindaPerl6::Runtime::Perl6::Grammar

* KindaPerl6::Runtime::Perl5::Match
  was moved to
  KindaPerl6::Runtime::Perl6::Match

* KindaPerl6::Runtime::Perl5::Pad
  started to be translated to
  KindaPerl6::Runtime::Perl6::Pad

* KindaPerl6::Runtime::Perl5::Runtime was changed
  to load the Perl6 version of the above files
