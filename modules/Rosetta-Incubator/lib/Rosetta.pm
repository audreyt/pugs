Linking Rosetta statically or dynamically with other files is making a
combined work based on Rosetta.  Thus, the terms and conditions of the GPL
cover the whole combination.  As a special exception, the copyright holders
of Rosetta give you permission to link Rosetta with independent files,
regardless of the license terms of these independent files, and to copy

provided that every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a complete
copy of the source code of Rosetta (the version of Rosetta used to produce
the combined work), being distributed under the terms of the GPL plus this
exception.  An independent file is a file which is not derived from or
based on Rosetta, and which is fully useable when not linked to Rosetta in
any form.

Any versions of Rosetta that you modify and distribute must carry prominent
notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any changes, in
addition to preserving this original copyright notice and other credits.

While it is by no means required, the copyright holders of Rosetta would
appreciate being informed any time you create a modified version of Rosetta
that you are willing to distribute, because that is a practical way of
suggesting improvements to the standard version.
