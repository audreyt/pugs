# P37 (**) Calculate Euler's totient function phi(m) (improved).
# 
# See problem P34 for the definition of Euler's totient function. If the list of
# the prime factors of a number m is known in the form of problem P36 then the
# function phi(m) can be efficiently calculated as follows: Let ((p1 m1) (p2 m2)
# (p3 m3) ...) be the list of prime factors (and their multiplicities) of a given
# number m. Then phi(m) can be calculated with the following formula:
# 
# phi(m) = (p1 - 1) * p1 ** (m1 - 1) + (p2 - 1) * p2 ** (m2 - 1) + (p3 - 1) * p3 ** (m3 - 1) + ...
# 
# Note that a ** b stands for the b'th power of a.

# This made me mad, the above formula is wrong
# where it says + it should be *
# based on the fact that
#  phi(prime**m)=prime**(m-1)*(prime-1)
# and
#  some_number=some_prime**n * some_other_prime**m * ....
