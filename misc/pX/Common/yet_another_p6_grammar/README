This directory is a little experiment in converting the redsix parser
grammar into other forms.

Currently the only form is p6 rules.  This was intended mainly to be
read by humans, as input into creating the official p6 grammar.

It could also be converted into a p5-plus-rules grammar, to be run by
one of the regexp engine spike derivatives.
