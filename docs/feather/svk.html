Fellow users:
<p>
In order to save bandwidth and speed up development, please set up
the svk environment in your home directory as such:

<pre>
   mkdir ~/.svk
   cp ~autrijus/config ~/.svk/
   svk co //mirror/pugs ~/pugs
</pre>
<p>
Afterwards, whenever you want to update your pugs copy:

<pre>
   cd ~/pugs
   svk pull
</pre>

The same applies to Parrot as well:

<pre>
   svk co /parrot/mirror/trunk ~/parrot
</pre>

<p>
Note the command is "svk", not "svn", although all svn commands
are supported by svk as well, except svk runs them faster.


<p>
The <code>//mirror/p6</code> directory contains the svn.perl.org Perl 6 repository, which
contains the design documents, and a fallback mirror of Pugs

<p>
Thanks!<br>
