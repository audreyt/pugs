This directory contains some code from a slightly updated version of
misc/pX/Common/regexp_and_parser_spike/ [1].  The main difference is
some work has been pulled out into a configurable factory class, the
main item of interest.

These files were ripped from a larger context, slightly massaged, and
then _not_ tested.  They are mainly intended for reference.

[1] regexp_and_parser_spike was a prototype showing a regular expression
engine could be written in perl5 with acceptable performance, and then
that a perl6 parser could be built on top of it.
