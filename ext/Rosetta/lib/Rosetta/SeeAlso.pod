=head1 NAME

Rosetta::SeeAlso -
External resources that you really ought to look at

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document is a central location within the "Rosetta" distribution where
any important recommendations of or links to external resources go.  This
includes both resources that helped me when I made Rosetta, as well as
Resources that are or could be related to Rosetta.

=head1 INFORMATION SOURCES

During my work on this project, I found the following resources to be
particularly useful:

=over

=item B<The Third Manifesto>

L<http://www.thethirdmanifesto.com/> is the main home on the web for
Christopher J. Date's and Hugh Darwen's proposal for a foundation for data
and database management systems, which Rosetta is officially an
implementation of.  It contains various useful documents and links on the
subject, especially
L<http://web.onetel.com/~hughdarwen/TheThirdManifesto/CHAP03.pdf>.  See
also the brand new release of their book containing the full proposal,
"Databases, Types, and The Relational Model: The Third Manifesto, 3rd
edition, Addison-Wesley, 2006 (ISBN: 0-321-44281-4)", at
L<http://www.aw-bc.com/catalog/academic/product/0,1144,0321399420,00.html>.

=item B<Database in Depth>

See Christopher J. Date's "Database in Depth: Relational Theory for
Practitioners, 1st edition, Oreilly, 2006 (ISBN: 0-596-10012-4)" at
L<http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/databaseid/>.  This is the first printed
book that I read fully, which is related to The Third Manifesto, and it was
my main introduction.  It explains in an easy to follow matter just what
the relational data model really is, a solid and provable logical system,
and partially contrasts with SQL's distorted view of it.  While being easy
to follow, the book is written towards people that are already database
professionals, and doesn't go into the basics that we should already know.

=item L<http://www.acm.org/classics/nov95/toc.html>

Edgar F. Codd - "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks"

Reprinted from I<Communications of the ACM>, Vol. 13, No. 6, June 1970, pp.
377-387. Copyright Â© 1970, Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.

This is the second famous 1969/1970 publication that first presented a
relational model of data to the world, which is the basis for the modern
database industry.

=item L<http://www.wiscorp.com/SQLStandards.html>

This web page of Whitemarsh Information Systems Corporation, run by one of
the people on the SQL standard drafting community, has copies of the
official SQL:2003 and SQL:1999 specification documents, and other related
helpful documents about SQL, in PDF format.  For example, "an almost
indistinguishable delta on the actual SQL 2003 database standard" is at
L<http://www.wiscorp.com/sql/sql_2003_standard.zip> (warning, large file).

=item L<http://www.unicode.org/standard/standard.html>

Unicode Standard official documentation.

=item L<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model>

The Wikipedia article on the relational data model, and related topics.

Also, the vendor documentation for various relational and/or SQL databases
such as MySQL and SQLite were regularly consulted, and various other sites.
