    * QDRDBMS version 0.0.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    QDRDBMS-v0.0.0.tar.gz.  QDRDBMS version 0.0.0 for Perl 6 is not
    released at this time, if ever, since it is currently released only as
    part of the Perl6-Pugs project (in its ext/QDRDBMS/ subdirectory),
    which sets its own less frequent release schedule.  The rest of this
    Changes entry refers only to the Perl 5 version.

    * This is the first release of the Perl 5 QDRDBMS distribution, and the
    first release of any distribution to contain Perl 5 modules named
    QDRDBMS::*.

    * This is the initial file manifest:
