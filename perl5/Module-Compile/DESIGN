=== Possible Compilers

- Switch
- Inline
- Indented
- Spiffy
- Perl6::Subs
- Params::Validate


=== Concerns

- It should be easy to turn off specific compilers lexically

For instance:

    use Indented;

    sub foo:
        print "Hello\n"

    use Inline C;
    ...
    no Inline;

    sub bar:
        1

I don't want my Inline code to be filtered.
