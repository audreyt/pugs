    class ClassName {
	has $.public_instance_var;
	# Untyped instance variable, a readonly accessor is automatically
	# generated. Methods have readwrite access to $.instance_var.

	has $.public_instance_var is rw;
	# Untyped instance variable, a readwrite accessor is automatically
	# generated.

	has Type $.public_instance_var;
	# Typed instance variable.

	has $:private_instance_var;
	# Private instance variable, no accessor is automatically generated.
    }

Inheritance

    class ParentClass {...}

    class SubClass is ParentClass {...}
    # or
    class SubClass {
	is ParentClass;
	...;
    }

Subtypes

    my subtype Int::Odd of Int where { $^value % 2 == 1 };
    # Declaration of a new, lexical subtype of Int, allowing only odd integers.
    
    my Int::Odd $var = 3;    # valid
    $var++;                  # invalid

    my Int::Odd $var = 4;    # invalid
