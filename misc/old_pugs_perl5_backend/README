This is the old pugs perl5 backend.

It was the first alternate backend for pugs, followed shortly by
PIL2JS.  Development started 2005-07-14 (the name was used earlier for
something else), and ceased around 2005-10.  It stalled on the
inability of pugs to provide class information via PIL1.

Accomplishments: demonstrated alternate backends were possible and
easy; supported p6 runtime and metamodel development.

To try it, make sure "pugs" is in your path, and run PIL-Run/pugs-p5.pl.

It uses pugs to parse and compile p6, emitting PIL1, which is then
processed into p5 and run.  Prior to being replaced by v6, it could be
run as ./pugs -B PERL5.
