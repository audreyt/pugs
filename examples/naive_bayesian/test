Apples are good. I like Macintosh the best. 

I have an Orange iMac too. But I wish it was red. I wish I had a bunch of them actually. 

My neighbor Mr. Smith got one for his granny. She has a picture of Mt. Fugi on the desktop.

I wish I owned stock in apple. They are a good company, not in the red. My friend has a bunch of apple stock.
