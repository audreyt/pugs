<h2>Hyper Operators</h2>
Used to perform an operation per element of an array<br/>
This is similar to a loop that takes elements 0 from 
<code>@a</code> and <code>@b</code>, adds them
and puts the result in element 0 of <code>@c</code>.</br>
<pre>
my @c = @a >>+<< @b;
</pre>
Gives permission for the operation on different 
elements to be parallelized.<br/>
Good for the Concurrent Future<br/>
Type <code>:next</code> to continue
