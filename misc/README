= What happened to the modules directory?
===============================================================================

Don't Panic!

All of the modules that were in this directory have been moved to
repositories on FreePAN. (http://www.freepan.org)

All of the revision history has been kept intact.

All development of these modules will now happen on FreePAN instead of
the pugs repository.

Everyone that was a pugs maintainer as of April 4 2005 and also had a
CPAN id has been given a FreePAN account/repository of the same id.

Each module from this directory was moved into the FreePAN repository
correlating to the person who originally added it to here.

Everyone with a FreePAN repository is currently allow to commit to
anyone else's repository. This will change soon, but it will be very
easy to add a list or group of people as committer's to any module.

The modules in the "ext" are also on FreePAN but are mirrored in the
pugs repository. You should continue to make commits to pugs for ext
modules. Soon you will be able to commit to these modules on FreePAN
like the other modules.

As modules on FreePAN are completed, they will be mirrored in ext.

If you have questions about this move, please post them here:

    http://wiki.freepan.org/index.cgi?FreepanQuestions

and they will be answered here:

or ask autrijus, ingy, gugod or mugwump on irc.

= Pugs Modules Directory
===============================================================================

- What is this directory?

This directory is meant to be a temporary holding place for both perl6 module 
ports of perl5 modules, and any new perl6 modules people might want to write.
Eventually all that you see here will end up either on CPAN or the new FreePAN
(see this link for more information http://pugs.kwiki.org/?FreepanProposal).

- Do any of these modules work in Pugs?

No. At this point, none of these modules are expected to work with the current 
state of Pugs. All working modules (or close to working) are contained in the
ext/ directory.

- What is this good for then?

It is our hope that having a number of modules, each with their own test suites, 
will later serve as a kind of integration test for the more advanced features 
of Pugs. 

Also the act of porting perl5 modules helps to raise questions about how certain
things will be accomplished in perl6 and helps to expose some of the darker 
corners of the perl6 spec. Which is a good way to help the perl6-language group
in the development of the spec.

- How can I contribute?

Pick a module, port it, ask for a commiter-bit, and upload it. 

- What modules should I port?

Whatever you like. There are no restrictions nor expectations.

- Is there a How-To document for porting to perl6?

Yes, see modules/PORTING_HOWTO.
