pugs (6.2.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Build-Depend on libyaml-perl, libtest-tap-model-perl,
    libtest-tap-htmlmatrix-perl, libcompress-bzip2-perl. They are needed for
    smoking.
  * Use smoke-pugs instead of a simple Harness test.
  * Removed environment hook for not sending smoke results from debian/rules.
    PUGS_BUILD_OPTS can handle that now.
  * Suggest perl and spidermonkey-bin needed by -BJS and -BPerl5.
