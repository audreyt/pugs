doing just fine without the dollar sharp
proof of the momentum of the Perl 6 project
a really neat gismo
stealing all the good ideas it can from those other languages
providing the capability to evolve a little faster
officially Turing Complete
alive
happening now
an implementation of Perl 6
a love letter to the Cabal
a "Good Morning" to a sleepy programmers' community
known to clean up nicely in the shower
a coffee-cup thrown against the wall
cashing in the tuits
sensitive (to semantic, pragmatic, and cultural context)
to perl 6 what gestation is to birth
a marvel
a "Hello Perl!" from Haskell
test driven
"Perl6, now!"
a good thing
already fun and pretty near useful
going great shakes
proof of the concept of a perly functional language
strict by default
a hyperoperator applied to the collective Perl imagination
a grab-bag of new ways to shoot yourself in the foot
