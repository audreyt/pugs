This is intended to be a table that can be a guidance on what to work
on. Basically, in YAP6, we have types that must implement a standard
API. Here follows the list of types versus the methods.


Type / Method  Anything?   NEW   DESTR   STRNG   NUMBR  BOOLN  SCALAR  LIST  HASH  WHICH  CUSTOM
string         0           0     0       0       0      0      0       0     0     0      N/A

List           1           0     1       0       0      0      0       0     0     1      Needs some changes.
Pair           1           0     1       0       0      0      0       0     0     1      Ok.
Hash           1           0     1       0       0      0      0       0     0     1      Incomplete.


If you want to help, just take a look at one of the 1 and look how to
implement it in some of the zeroes, always creating a test,
please. When you implement it, just mark it as 1 or if you're not
sure, just put a question mark and explain below.
