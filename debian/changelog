pugs (6.2.12-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (Closes: #351945).
  * Added libghc6-plugins-dev build dependency to enable haskell eval support.
  * Added libparrot-dev build dependency to enable runtime evaluation of
    parrot code as well as the parrot backend for running Perl 6 code
    (-BPIR)
  * Removed dependency to pugs from pugs-modules to remove a circular
    dependnecy (Closes: #340022).
  * Use (= ${Source-Version}) instead of (>= ${Source-Version}) in the
    dependency from pugs to pugs-modules.
  * Use my @debian.org address for the Maintainer field.
  * I'm not sure if pugs still builds with ghc-cvs. Removing the
    build-dependency therefor.
  * Recompile against ghc6 6.4.2, thus bump up the versioned build-dependency.
  * Use the new upload-smoke target in debian/rules.
  * Re-add perl6.vim (Closes: #343565).
  * Remove libghc6-pugs-dev.
  * Bump up Standards version to 3.7.2.

pugs (6.2.10-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Renamed 30includedirs.dpatch to 30cabal.dpatch and added some more changes
    that should make installing libghc6-pugs-dev finally work.
  * Removed libghc6-plugins-dev build-dep. It isn't in sid yet anyway.

pugs (6.2.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Build-Depend on libyaml-perl, libtest-tap-model-perl,
    libtest-tap-htmlmatrix-perl, libcompress-bzip2-perl. They are needed for
    smoking.
  * Use smoke-pugs instead of a simple Harness test.
  * Removed environment hook for not sending smoke results from debian/rules.
    PUGS_BUILD_OPTS can handle that now.
  * Suggest perl and spidermonkey-bin needed by -BJS and -BPerl5.
