<h1>FAQ: Can I use CGI/mod_perl on feather?</h1>
<p>
Yes, but not via the default Apache. Every form of web development requires
specific settings, and that makes maintenance hard. It is, however, very easy
to run your own Apache. Here's how:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
cp -rp ~juerd/apache ~
perl -i -pe's/juerd/$ENV{USER}/g' ~/apache/httpd.conf
perl -i -pe's/Listen 8000/"Listen " . (7000 + $&lt;)/e' ~/apache/httpd.conf
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
To start your web server, run <tt>/usr/sbin/apache -f ~/apache/httpd.conf</tt>.
To stop it, run <tt>killall apache</tt> (ignore that it couldn't kill the
system wide apaches).
</p>
<h1>FAQ: How do I redirect my feather email to my other mail address?</h1>
<p>
Use qmail's .qmail system. See <tt>man dot-qmail</tt> for details.
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
echo '&other-address@example.org' > ~/.qmail
</pre>
</blockquote>
