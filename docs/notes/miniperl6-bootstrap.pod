1. cp EmitRuleP5Ratchet into EmitRuleP6Rathet and prefix all subs with "use v5"
2. Use v6.pm to convert EmitRuleP6Ratchet into EmitRuleP5Ratchet 
3. Port EmitRuleP6Ratchet by hand to Mini Perl 6 (without using P6 Rules or advanced OO stuff)
---- Here We Declare Grammar Engine is Bootstrapped ----
4. Write v6/Emit(MiniPerl6->Perl5) and redo step 3 to make an optimized PCR/EmitRuleP5Ratchet
5. Rewrite v6/Grammar/Expression.pm to port Yapp-dependent parts into <%foo> style tokens 
6. Convert all of v6/Grammar/* to MiniPerl6 and emitted to optimized Perl 5 code
---- Here We Declare Perl 6 Parser is Bootstrapped ----
7. Port Data::Capture and Data::Bind to MiniPerl6
8. Port MO to MiniPerl6

[1,2,3].foo




sub foo (Int $x) {...}
##################
use v6-alpha;
my $x = (1,2,3);

sub foo (@x) {...}
foo($x);

use v5;

my $x = SomeInternalFunctionToMakeLockedArrayRef([1,2,3]);
sub foo { my ($at_x) = @_; ... }
foo($x);

# The Difference between MP6 and P6 is thus:
    - Only allow one feed of positional arguments
    - Allow interpolated positional arguments (|@x)
    - In Signature, disallow "is slurpy", "is optional", "is named"
        (*@bad) ($bad?) (:$bad)
    - But we do allow Hash and Array and Tree unpacking:
        sub foo ([$a, $b, $c, Tree $top ($left, $right)], {:$x, :$y}) { ... }
        foo([1, 2, 3], { x => 1, y => 2 }, Tree({ left => 1, right => 2});

        # This compiles to:
        sub foo {
            my perl6::Tree $top;
            my ($a, $b, $c, $x, $y, $left, $right);
            ($a, $b, $c, $top)  = @{$_[0]};
            ($x, $y)            = @{$_[1]}{'x', 'y'};
            ($left, $right)     = @{$_[0][3]}{'left', right');
            ...
        }
        foo([1, 2, 3], { x => 1, y => 2 });

    - As a consequence, object constructor calls must be written in
      conercion form:
        Foo({x => 1, y => 2});  # NOT Foo.new

    - Only allow item context
    - No laziness; all List are Seq
    - No subtyping (inheritance) or role mixins
    - No first-class Capture and Signature objects, which means no \$x nor :(foo)
    - No assignment, only bindings, but don't panic:
        $x := $x + 1;   # name = IntOp(named(Int))
        # $x = $x + 1
      The reason is we have to eliminate one of them to avoid dealing with:
        $x := $y;
        $x = 123;
      Because assignment always involve box(unbox()), so emitting binding to
      Perl 5 is much more straightforward as $x is always just a Int in
      ($x := $x + 1), never SomePossiblyTiedScalarContainerType that needs to
      have special FETCH magic associated with it.

      Also it's inevitable with eliminating list context, because:
        ($x, $y, $z) := (1, 2); # compile-time error
        ($x, $y, $z) = (1, 2);  # list-context-undef-fill that we don't want to deal with
      because infix:<=> almost always imply slurpiness with LHS is not a simple scalar,
      eliminating it is consistent with eliminating list context.

    - Allow Type annotations. Preserve them Perl 5 emitted code using simple Typed vars:
        # MiniPerl6
        my Int $x;
        my perl5:CGI $x;

        # Compiled Perl 5
        my perl6::Int $x;
        my CGI $x;
      However, the compiler adds no extra assertions so types never slows programs down
      in MiniPerl6 land.

    - Closures, but no coroutines nor continuations
    - Declarators: my/state/has/constant.  We don't have "our", and we don't have $Q::Var
    - Hypotheticals: temp
    - Fatal is always in effect; "fail" fails immediately
    - Closed grammatical categories and precedence levels
    - No macros; no BEGIN blocks!
    - No multis (for now; may revisit)
