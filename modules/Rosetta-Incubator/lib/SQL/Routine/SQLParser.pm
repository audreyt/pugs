Linking SQL::Routine::SQLParser statically or dynamically with other

the terms and conditions of the GPL cover the whole combination.  As a
special exception, the copyright holders of SQL::Routine::SQLParser give
you permission to link SQL::Routine::SQLParser with independent modules,
regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy
and distribute the resulting combined work under terms of your choice,
provided that every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a complete
copy of the source code of SQL::Routine::SQLParser (the version of
SQL::Routine::SQLParser used to produce the combined work), being
distributed under the terms of the GPL plus this exception.  An independent
module is a module which is not derived from or based on
SQL::Routine::SQLParser, and which is fully useable when not linked to
SQL::Routine::SQLParser in any form.

Any versions of SQL::Routine::SQLParser that you modify and distribute must
carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of
any changes, in addition to preserving this original copyright notice and

While it is by no means required, the copyright holders of

a modified version of SQL::Routine::SQLParser that you are willing to
distribute, because that is a practical way of suggesting improvements to
the standard version.
