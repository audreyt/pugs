=head1 DESCRIPTION

This set of modules is a prototype for the Perl 6 Metaclass model, which is the
model which descibes the interactions of classes, objects and roles in the Perl
6 object space. 

I am prototyping this in Perl 5 as part of the Perl 6 -> PIL compiler to run on
a Perl5 VM.  It is currently in the early stages of a refactoring from the
original which was just a hacked together prototype. 

=head1 EXPORTED FUNCTIONS

These functions are exported and are thin wrappers around the Perl6::Class and Perl6::Role
modules to make class/role construction easier.

=head1 SEE ALSO

=over 4

=item All the Perl 6 documentation. 

In particular the Apocolypse and Synopsis 12 which describes the object system.

=item L<Class::Role>, L<Class::Roles> & L<Class::Trait>

The first two are early attempts to prototype role behavior, and the last is an implementation
of the Trait system based on the paper which originally inspired Roles.

=item Any good Smalltalk book.

I prefer the Brown book by Adele Goldberg and David Robinson, but any one which talks about the
smalltalk metaclasses is a good reference.

=item CLOS

The Common Lisp Object System has a very nice meta-model, and plently of reference on it. In 
particular there is a small implementation of CLOS called TinyCLOS which is very readable (if 
you know enough Scheme that is)
