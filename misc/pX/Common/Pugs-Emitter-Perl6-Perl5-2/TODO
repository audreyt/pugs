Compile-Time objects

- rename .set -> .STORE
- create .FETCH

- implement 'Code' class, with multi-dispatch
- replace 'Range' implementation with a lazy runtime object

- organize the internal "Namespaces"
  - maybe follow S06:Built-in Types:
    Mutable Immutable Undefined Value ...
  - or follow the pugs/ast model ?

  - find a place for specialized objects like Perl5 containers

- use some standard tool to make ast transformations
