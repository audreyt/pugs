    - Fixed test suite
      (Removed YAML dependency;
       Instead of line-by-line comparison of serializations, the
       tests now walk the expected and actual DOM representations in parallel,
       comparing node values via the objects' accessor methods;
       This version of the test suite could easily be adapted to any
       implementation of Pod parsing. Look at the 'make_tests' program and
       the 't_source' directory to see how the tests are now declaratively
       specified and auto-generated.
      )

    - Added missing style() accessor method

    - Fixed handling (and on-the-fly creation) of =headN and =itemN classes

    - Numerous other minor fixes pointed out by new test suite
