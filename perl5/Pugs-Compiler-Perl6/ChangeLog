- command-line switch -B can be set to alternate backends.
  The default is '-Bperl5:Pugs::Emitter::Perl6::Perl5'.
  '-Bperl5' also invokes the default backend.
- command-line switch -G can be set to alternate grammar frontends.
  The default is '-Gperl5:Pugs::Grammar::Perl6'
- added a version banner - perl lib/v6.pm -v
- eval() in caller's context

[devel only]

- moved Perl5 emitter to a separate module
- implemented $$/
- implemented :c and :g switches in rules:
  ' my $content = "xyz"; while $content ~~ m:c/<alpha>/ { say $/ } '
  x \n y \n z \n
- implemented  '$x.yaml'  and  'eval( $x, :lang<yaml> )'

0.015  2006-09-14

- improved command-line interface, does not require using v6.pm as a
  script.
- MANIFEST only includes passing tests
- reuse Rule and Pod grammar from Pugs::Compiler::Rule
  - These grammars are now implemented using v6.pm.
  - The Rule grammar is subclassed, in order to callback P6 parser to
  compile closures.
- improved quoted text parsing
- gradually replace Text::Balanced with plain rules
  - Term::substitution() and rx_body() are the last remaining places.
- experimental implementation of compile-time objects
  - lib/Pugs/Emitter/Perl6/Perl5/
  - not merged yet - see misc/pX/fglock

0.014  2006-08-21

- optimized CPU usage (2x less) and RAM usage (3x less)

- implemented given/when/default/break/continue
- state variables
- implemented additional Array and Hash methods
- $?PUGS_BACKEND returns 'BACKEND_PERL5'
- implemented @*INC, $?OS, $?COMPILER, $?VERSION
- implemented statement terminator block

- fixed scientific notation
- fixed '{}' (empty hash)
- %hash = ( { a => 1 }, { b => 2 } ) works
- 'my' works inside '//' and 'err'
- optimized match object insideout in Pugs::Compiler::Rule
- optimized operator-precedence parser (Parse::Yapp) initialization

0.013  2006-08-09

- includes precompiled v6 modules: Perl6Prelude.pm, Test.pm
- new grammatical categories: 'quote', 'statement_modifier'

0.012  2006-08-08

- faster compilation due to improved grammatical categories dispatching
  and lazy rule compilation
- 'statement_control' grammatical category implemented

0.011  2006-07-24

- basic regex parsing and matching
- grammar/rule parsing
- support := with Data::Bind::bind_op2
- basic hash support
- class name barewords are allowed. Str and Bool in Prelude
- implement $?POSITION and $?CALLER::POSITION.
- 788 tests pass

0.010  2006-07-17

- better support for array and hash syntax; - clkao++
  'sub' declarations are terms:
    @b.map(sub ($x, $y) { $x + $y })
- 'loop' - clkao++
- fixed HACKING file formatting - snowstalker++
- fixed docs on 'use v6-alpha' - dduncan++
- 538 tests pass

0.009  2006-07-14

- reduce operators: say [*] 1..5
- 499 tests pass

0.008  2006-07-14

- 'use perl5:CGI'
- chain operators
- fixed precedence table

0.007  2006-07-12

- added HACKING file
- added Pugs::Runtime::Perl6Prelude
- added t/Test.pm
-- unmodified copy of pugs ext/Test/lib/Test.pm
- parsing is now done one statement at a time 
-- this cuts memory needs by half while compiling Test.pm
- use v5; ... use v6;
-- inlines perl 5 code
- named enums
- bool::True, bool::False, true()
- unless, while
- setting $ENV{V6DUMPAST} can now be used for debugging the syntax tree

0.006  2006-07-06

- we now no longer use Parse::Yapp
- all expression parsing is done with Perl 6 grammar
- regex/token/rule declarations in Perl 6 are parsed
- uses Moose 0.10 for Perl 6 classes and objects
- squash warnings

0.005  2006-07-05

- all sanity tests, up and includes Test.pm from Pugs test suite, now passes
- uses Data::Bind for calling convention
- 'expr unless/if expr;'

0.003 - 0.004

- "Changed everything to make Test.pm compile"
- grammar rewrite; now uses Parse::Yapp for expressions only

0.002  2006-06-28

- added REQUIREMENTS section in v6.pm pod
-- see http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=20152

- uses Moose.pm as the runtime for classes
-- implemented 'module' and 'class'
-- very basic support for 'has', 'method', and parameter list
-- Makefile.PL recommends 'Moose' 

- properly parses pod
-- added t/01-pod.t 

- more operators
-- added a default '.perl' implementation, which calls perl5 Dumper()

- v6.pm no longer searches in development lib directories

0.001  2006-06-26

- initial CPAN release
