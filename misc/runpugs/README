2006/12/12      Release of version 0.2.0 of runpugs/WebTerminal
==============================================================================

NAME
    runpugs: a web teminal for interactive pugs 
    Web/Terminal: library for building a web terminal for interactive shells

INSTALLATION
    * To install, copy all folders to your web root
    (e.g. ~/apache on feather, or /var/www elsewhere)
    Rename html folder if required (e.g. htdocs -> html or public_html)
    * Start the terminal server script (bin/termserv2.pl) 
    * To run, simply point your browser to /cgi-bin/runpugs (stable CGI
     version) or just /runpugs/ (unstable version with asynchronous
     JavaScript interface, running under mod_perl)

DESCRIPTION
    runpugs has two main components: 
    -a cgi script (cgi-bin/runpugs) which uses an html template
    (data/runpugs.html). The latter calls the runpugs.css stylesheet from
    htdocs/runpugs.css
    -a server (bin/termserv2.pl) which handles the interactive pugs sessions and communicates with
    the cgi script. The pugs sessions stay alive for some time (currently 10') if
    left inactive.

    The unstable version has some AJAX-like goodness and runs under mod_perl.
    The entrypoint is /htdocs/runpugs/index.html, which calls /perl/runpugs.pl

   The underlying library, Web/Terminal, can in principle be used for any
   interactive shell, not just pugs. So we could have runpython :-)
   See the POD for more info.
