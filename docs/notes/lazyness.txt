A draft on the runtime view of how Lazy things (like Arrays) work

- Definitions

-- Array is a subclass of "Container"

Array can do "map", "grep", splice, push, pop, store, fetch. 
Array can be "bound" and "tied".
Array contains an ordered set of Scalar.

-- List is a subclass of "Value"

List is an anonymous set of things.
At runtime, you only access List elements through Containers.
A List slice is an Array that contains List elements.

-- Generator is an object that represent a set of things 

Generator is like a List, but it is "functional" rather than "physical memory"

-- Slice

-- Hash
