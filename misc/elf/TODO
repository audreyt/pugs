Things you can do to help...

*** Update ../STD_red/PROBLEMS.
It's fallen out of sync with what actually parses.

*** Fix or document test failues.
Go through the run-tests results.
For each "ran but test failed", look at why.
If it's a missing or defective bit of prelude, either
 mention it below, or
 fix the prelude.
If it's an emitter problem, mention it below.

If it's a parser problem or failure ("X"), 
determine why the parse failed, and add a one-liner which
replicates it to ../STD_red/PROBLEMS.

*** Flesh out the prelude.
Go through S29 etc, adding p6 implementations to one of the preludes.
If it doesn't compile as spec'ed, comment it out so it serves as a todo.



TODO

* remove the following distastefull deviations
  - re_gsub

* replace cruft like  $.var.sigil eq '$' in Emit with methods in/added-to Analysis.  eg, is_scalar. (http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2008-05-24#i_309702)
