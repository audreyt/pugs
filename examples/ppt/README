Perl6 Power Tools

This directory, inspired by the original Unix Reconstruction Project[1],
contains implementations of Unix tools in Perl6, intended to be runnable
on non-Unix machines.

We'll include a Makefile that uses pugscc to build the whole tree,
resulting in fast tools.

Notes:

+ Make it portable. That's the whoel point.
+ BSD or GNU style options[2]? Both!
+ You can use external modules, but it's considered courteous to also
  write those if they don't exist yet. :-)
