TODO list for KindaPerl6

The kp6 Milestones are:

- lexical subs 
- metamodel interface
  - bootstrap == kp6-2
- lexical classes
- begin blocks
- containers

Starting Code freeze

- translate perl5 runtime to mp6?
- translate the compiler front-end to mp6
- test suite
- debugging
- minimal runtime
- bootstrap?
- plan Perl6-in-Perl6

The optional features in kp6 are:

- coro 
- macro
- multi
- private method/sub/accessor
- junctions
- signatures with optional, named, slurpy arguments
- a better parser 
    - $?FILE, $?LINE
    - finer-grained error messages
- precompilation
- compiler cache
- version checking
- user-clonable closures
    - $closure.clone - creates new pads with copies of lexicals
- lexically modifieable Grammar

Incomplete features:

+ try(), eval()
+ 'Code' closure objects
+ 'Capture' objects
+ classes, methods, at compile-time
+ short-circuiting <&&>, <||>, <?? !!> (require macros, or laziness)

- 'let' variables
- 'our' variables
- CATCH blocks

- method hyperization is untested
- binding does no type check

- (FIXED) all variables initialized during compilation should have initializers for run-time
- traits
    - is context, rw, readonly
- containers, but no laziness, no slices
    - hash and array are under refactoring
    - P6opaque
    - GLOBAL importation should be lexical
    - method not found falls back to sub call
    - lvalue methods (rw)
    - call context
- type system
- optimization phase
- for-loop, map, with several arguments
- (FIXED) begin-blocks with side-effects
- subroutine calls, data, are incompatible with perl 5
- no 'use v5'
- declare our/state/temp/constant things    

- missing GLOBAL::import() at compile-time
- 'our $x' should compile to 'my $x ::= $Pkgname::x'
- 'use GLOBAL $x' should compile to 'my $x ::= $GLOBAL::x'

- perl6-land 'use'
- COMPILING::<$?PARSER>
- translate the COMPILER package to mp6
- translate Pad.pm and Type.pm to mp6

- create an AST node for INIT/END

BEGIN blocks:

- (FIXED) an anonymous subroutine is generated, but it is not called at runtime
- logging of array/hash element modifications is not implemented
- binding to Value is not emitted

- Method and Class doesn't have '.perl'

Bugs:

- missing compile-time methods

- compile-time does not import GLOBAL - 'say' doesn't work inside BEGIN blocks

- grammar: 'undefine($v)' is not parsed
- structure binding/assign is untested

Bootstrap:

- add a switch for 'mp6 emulation', so that kp6 can be compiled efficiently using itself

Roles:

- (FIXED) possible implementation:
    $Obj->{Role_bool} = sub { 1 };
  at runtime:
    $Obj->{Role_bool} && $Obj->{Role_bool}() || $Obj->bool()
- problem: objects based on p5-array (Array), p5-code (Code)
    - p5-land objects will only have Moose-based roles

Optimization:

- TODO
  
Perl5 compatibility:

- mark closure blocks as p5 or p6 (kp6/mp6)
  
Problems running the Perl6 test suite:
  
- kp6 requires a 'compilation unit' declaration
- '&&', '||' operators don't short circuit
- (FIXED) 'if', 'sub' require ';'
- prefix and postfix:<++> not implemented
- 'use' doesn't accept parameters: use lib ".";
- parameter list error in:
    if defined $var { ...
  requires:
    if defined($var) { ...
- no END blocks

Visitor modules:

- deprecated modules:
    KindaPerl6::Visitor::LexicalSub
    KindaPerl6::Visitor::CreateEnv

- (FIXED) add variable declarations collector -- XXX now obsolete!
  - move variable declarations to the start of each block

- LexicalSub.pm -- XXX now obsolete!
  - add 'our' subs to the namespace, if there is one
  - verify the interface with native p5 subs, such as 'Main::say'
  - only create a "lexical sub" call if the sub is in scope

- MetaClass.pm
  - add class variables
  - test bootstrap
  - roles
  - alias Class::MOP's 'meta' to 'HOW'
    ---
    package Class::MOP::Class;
    sub meta { Class::MOP::Class->initialize(blessed($_[0]) || $_[0]) }  
    ---
  - create BUILD, BUILDALL

Other:

- star/GLOBAL namespace -- done!
    zzz()
    --> ($_SUB_zzz || $GLOBAL::_SUB_zzz)->(@args)
    $*foo
    --> $GLOBAL::foo
    but:
    TimToady> under strict there is no fallback to global unless you explicitly import (you also get a snapshot of GLOBAL imported automatically at the start of compilation)
  - what are the differences between compiling modules and compile plain-programs

- OUTER namespace
- ROUTINE
- tail-calls

For later:

- desugar blocks into real subroutines, in support for the parrot backend
  - fixed by now, using p6parrot as an intermediate language

- desugar closures into simple subroutines, in support for the C backend

- temp/state desugaring, for perl5

- 6-on-6 design
  - full-ast
