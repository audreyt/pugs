The Synopsis files are now downloaded by the util/testgraph.pl script
for the sake of testing test coverage (the original reason they were
loaded in here).

This is because the specification is categorically not a part of the
pugs compiler.  Including them here was a stop-gap measure.

If you are after the Canon for the sake of reference, it can be
downloaded via the Perl6::Bible CPAN module, or point phasers at the
on-line reference material:

   http://dev.perl.org/perl6/synopsis/

These are also available via Subversion / SVK using the URL:

   http://svn.perl.org/perl6/doc/trunk/design/syn
