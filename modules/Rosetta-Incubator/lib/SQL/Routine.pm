Linking SQL::Routine statically or dynamically with other modules is making
a combined work based on SQL::Routine.  Thus, the terms and conditions of
the GPL cover the whole combination.  As a special exception, the copyright
holders of SQL::Routine give you permission to link SQL::Routine with
independent modules, regardless of the license terms of these independent
modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting combined work under terms
of your choice, provided that every copy of the combined work is
accompanied by a complete copy of the source code of SQL::Routine (the
version of SQL::Routine used to produce the combined work), being
distributed under the terms of the GPL plus this exception.  An independent
module is a module which is not derived from or based on SQL::Routine, and
which is fully useable when not linked to SQL::Routine in any form.

Any versions of SQL::Routine that you modify and distribute must carry
prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any
changes, in addition to preserving this original copyright notice and other
credits. SQL::Routine is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

While it is by no means required, the copyright holders of SQL::Routine
would appreciate being informed any time you create a modified version of
SQL::Routine that you are willing to distribute, because that is a
practical way of suggesting improvements to the standard version.
