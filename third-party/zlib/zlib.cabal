synopsis:        Compression and decompression in the gzip and zlib formats
description:     This package provides a pure interface for compressing and 
                 decompressing streams of data represented as lazy 
                 'ByteString's. It uses the zlib C library so it has high
                 performance. It supports the \"zlib\", \"gzip\" and \"raw\"
                 compression formats.
                 .
                 It provides a convenient high level api suitable for most
                 tasks and for the few cases where more control is needed it
                 provides access to the full zlib feature set.
