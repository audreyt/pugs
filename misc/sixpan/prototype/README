This is the 2nd generation PMS prototype. This version is completely free of
dpkg, but quite inspired by it's functionality and policy. To test the
prototype, type the following commands from the README directory:

    # cleanup fakeroot and build directories, set up fresh root
    $ perl bin/cleanup.pl
    
    # create an archive, will build into root-p5-foo-bar
    $ perl bin/create.pl p5-foo
    
    # install that archive into our fakeroot
    $ perl bin/install.pl root-p5-foo/p5-Foo-1.0-cpan+KANE.jib

    # inspect the fakeroot:
    $ find fakeroot | less
    
    # uninstall the package
    $ perl bin/uninstall.pl p5-Foo-1.0-cpan+KANE
    
    # inspect the fakeroot:
    $ find fakeroot | less
    
    # see what's been installed
    $ perl bin/pp_install.pl
    
    # cleanup fakeroot and build directories, set up fresh root
    $ perl bin/cleanup.pl

Try building the files in p5-foo-bar and p5-foo-bar2 as well.

Check README.repo for sample code on how to test installs using a fake
repository.
