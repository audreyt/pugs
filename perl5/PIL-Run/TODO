Usage tip:
 $ pugs -v
[...] # pugs is in your path
 $ pwd
 .../perl5/PIL-Run
 $ perl -w crude_repl.pl


Here are some things which would help move development along on the p5
runtime.

* Implement primitives.  Primitives are perl5 subs in
PIR/Run/PrimP5.pm.  lc, lcfirst, etc.  Many of them are unimplemented,
having yada yada bodies: {...}.  Implement some.  Use the ApiX subs
like p6_to_n and p6_from_n to unpack your arguments and repack your
results.  Or if they can be written in terms of other primitives,
write them in p6, and add them either to the perl6/Prelude.pm
(preferred), or to PIL/Run/Root/P5Runtime/PrimP6.pm (less so), and
comment them out in PrimP5 (with a note saying why).

* MainX should load PIL/Run/Root/P5Runtime/PrimP6.pm at startup.

Slightly more distant tasks:
* Get the prelude to compile.
* Get Test.pm to run.
* Get the examples/eval.pm p6 read-eval-print loop to run.
