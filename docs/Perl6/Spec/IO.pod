This is a draft document. Many of these functions will work as in Perl 5,
except we're trying to rationalize everything into packages.  For now you can
assume most of the important ones will automatically be in the * namespace.

As a starting point, you can help by finding the official Perl 5 documentation
for these functions and copying it here.
