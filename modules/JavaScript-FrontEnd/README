JavaScript Frontend

This directory is intended for the development of a JavaScript
_frontend_ for p6.  It has nothing to do with the existing JavaScript
_backend_.  These are p6 modules which parse and compile JS code into
p6, and provide a p6-based JS runtime.

This project is currently on hold as there are higher priority ones.

My current thought on the runtime is it needs to be more automagically
generated from the spec.  Human involvement is required, but the degree
of hand editing used with the current file would require days to do the
entire runtime, and no doubt introduce errors.
