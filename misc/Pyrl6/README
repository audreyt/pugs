Pyrl6 - Perl 6 in Python
Conceived by David Koenig <karhu@u.washington.edu>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Theoretically, this should be an implementation of Perl 6 in Python. It's not
there yet actually :)

Our main inspiration is Redsix, found in:
 http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/misc/pX/Common/redsix

That was the same project in Ruby, but it fell by the wayside.

If you want to help, just throw your name in ./PYGEEKS so I know who to yell
at if anything goes wrong, er, call for help.
