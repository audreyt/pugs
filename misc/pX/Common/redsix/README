redsix is a partial implementation of perl6 written in ruby.

It was originally written in Spring '06.  Then the need for it seemed
to go away (haskell pugs was again active), and so it was abandoned.
That's the 2006/ directory.

In early 2008, we were still awaiting Christmas (p6 availability), and
it was dusted off as one of several partial implementations of parts
of p6, which might hopefully be mixed together to get a more robust
development process.  That's this directory.

NOTES

The parser grammar was snarfed from pugs.  Which is now somewhat out
of date.  It does not include a p6 regex implementation - it uses p5
regexp plus subrules.

EXAMPLES:

 prove -e ./redsix ../../../../t/01-sanity
