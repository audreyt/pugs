Pugs-Emitter-Perl6-Perl5-2

This module implements an internal object system for the perl5 emitter.

It replaces the use of Data::Bind with double indirection, which is 
probably slower.

However, this opens possibilities for supporting more
language features, as it is closer to the way PIL-Run worked.
- compile-time autoboxing
- junctions
- laziness
