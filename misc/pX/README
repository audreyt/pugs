Once upon a time, the lambdacamels were pondering possible development
paths to a working perl6.  One strawman proposal, which lasted only a
day or two, never the less included a useful idea.  At the time, pieces
of the pugs development tree were too tightly tied to individual people.
It was interfering with collaborative development.  So part of the
proposal was to have a place for personal directories, so that need
wouldn't have to be met elsewhere.  And at the other extreme, to have a
playpen, a "scratch" directory, for more free wheeling collaboration
than one might want in the "working" tree.  Such directories were
created for illustration, and though the proposal didn't last, the
directories did.

Feel free to drop files and directories of any type in pX/Common/.

Common/lrep/README describes a major project.

Aside/PXNotes is the stawman proposal which resulted in this directory.
It includes some thoughts on social conventions, and on moving old stuff
to Aside, but Common hasn't been chaotic/lively enough yet for this to
be an issue.
