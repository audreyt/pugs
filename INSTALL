BUILDING PUGS
-------------

Pugs needs the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) 6.4 or above.  To install GHC,
download a binary build from http://haskell.org/ghc/.  Although source code
for GHC is available, it will take a very long time to build by yourself. 

Pugs needs Parrot 0.2.2 or above to support Perl 6 Rules and PIR evaluation.
To install Parrot, follow the instructions at http://www.parrotcode.org/.

http://www.jwcs.net/~jonathan/perl6/ has binary builds for Win32.  If you'd
like to build by hand, http://wiki.kn.vutbr.cz/mj/?Perl%206%20and%20Parrot has
instructions (and binaries, too).

For dynamic loading/inlining of Haskell modules, you should install the
hs-plugin library, available here:

    http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/code/hs-plugins

To install Pugs on your system, simply type this in the command line:

    cpansign -v         # optional; see SIGNATURE for details
    perl Makefile.PL
    make                # or 'nmake' on Win32
    make test
    make install

To change the installation location, pass PREFIX=/opt/wherever to 
Makefile.PL like so:

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/your/prefix/here

XXX NOTE!!!!!!!!
PREFIX doesn't actually work right now. So ignore what I just said. But if
it did work, that's how you would do it.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------

There are several environment variables that control pugs's build process.

You may use the GHC environment variable to set the ghc executable before 
you run "perl Makefile.PL", for example:

    export GHC=${HOME}/bin/ghc (bash)
    setenv GHC ${HOME}/bin/ghc (csh)
    
To control which optional subsystems are embedded in Pugs, set the 
PUGS_EMBED variable. For example: 
 
    export PUGS_EMBED="perl5 parrot" (bash)
    setenv PUGS_EMBED "perl5 parrot" (csh)

To build with an embedded parrot interpreter, make sure the PUGS_EMBED 
variable contains "parrot", and set the PARROT_PATH variable to point to 
the directory in which you checked out the parrot source tree. For example:
 
    export PARROT_PATH=${HOME}/src/parrot (bash)
    setenv PARROT_PATH ${HOME}/src/parrot (csh)

MAKE TARGETS
------------

The default make target builds an optimized Pugs. This means that Pugs will
be slower to compile, but will run much faster. To disable this, run:
    
    make unoptimized  # unoptimised will work, too. We're not picky.

To run the test suite:

    make test

To make a pretty HTML matrix showing test results:

    make smoke
    
To run the test suite using the PIR backend:
    
    make pirtest
    
To make a pretty HTML matrix showing test results using the PIR backend:

    make pirsmoke

To turn on profiling in the GHC compiler:
 
    make profiled

CAVEATS FOR Win32 USERS
-------------------------

Embedding Perl5 is disabled GHC is built with MinGW/GCC and Perl 
is usually built with VC++, they cannot embed one another.
  
CAVEATS FOR GCC 4.0 USERS
-------------------------

Mac OS X 10.4 "Tiger" users may see this error message when compiling Pugs:

    ___DISCARD__
    collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

Until GHC 6.4.1 is released, you need to need to issue this command first:

    sudo gcc_select 3.3

Then recompile Pugs using a clean tree.  Other users of GCC 4.0 systems
may also need to switch to GCC 3.3 to compile Pugs for now.

CAVEATS FOR x86_64 MACHINES
---------------------------

Until GHC 6.4.1 is released, Linux users with x86_64 (64 bit Athlon) CPUs
should consider using a development snapshot of GHC:

    http://www.haskell.org/ghc/dist/stable/dist/
    
Look for files ending with "x86_64-unknown-linux", for example:

    ghc-6.4.1.20050711-x86_64-unknown-linux.tar.bz2

GHC 6.4 had bugs on x86_64 which broke garbage collection and rules (regexps).
These bugs were fixed in GHC CVS by around 11-May.  There are hints on using
snapshots at the end of this section.

Here are the known problems:

(1) GHC 6.4 has a garbage collector bug on x86_64 (64 bit Athlon) machines;
users may see crashes complaining about "strange objects".

A partial workaround is to avoid GC by requesting a large heap, using either
command line arguments:

    ./pugs +RTS -A200M -RTS

or an environment variable:

    GHCRTS='-A200M'

These request a 200 MB heap, which is sufficient to run most programs.

Running all tests unfortunately requires a lot more memory (perhaps 1000M).
A possible alternative, which someone could explore and report on, would be
to try using a 32-bit GHC instead.

(2) Rules (regexps) may not work with GHC 6.4 on x86_64.  Users may see
"internal error: adjustor creation not supported on this platform".
There is no known workaround.  This bug has been fixed in current
development snapshots.

Hints on using a development snapshot of GHC:

Note that this will take a long time, and it may not work.

First, check to see if a sufficiently recent "Stable" source snapshot is 
available (as of 15-May, there isn't one yet).  If not, you might try a "HEAD" 
snapshot (it is not clear that anyone has actually tried this).  Otherwise, you 
might use cvs to grab your own snapshot:

    CVSROOT=:pserver:anoncvs@glass.cse.ogi.edu:/cvs; export CVSROOT
    cvs login     # password cvs
    cvs checkout fpconfig
    cd fptools
    cvs checkout ghc hslibs libraries happy alex

    autoreconf
    ./configure
    make
    make install

There are no guarantees with a CVS snapshot.  It may not even compile.
