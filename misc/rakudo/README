FILES

parse_t_spec.t

  Runs the rakudo parser against t/.  Intended as a development tool
  to check rakudo parser coverage.

  After creating it, I concluded that t/ would be a more useful target
  than t/spec, I believe because t/spec was using a big subset of p6,
  making parsefails likely, in contrast to non-t/spec t/, which tried
  to be minimalistic.

elf_on_rakudo

  Part of the March 2008 winter_jig project.  An abandoned attempt to
  create a usable p6 implementation by combining the rakudo parser
  with a simple p5 backend.

  The rakudo parser proved too slow, taking a minute to do what other
  parsers could do in seconds, so the project was abandoned.  Match()s
  not being tagged with what rule generated them was also a problem.

  Future development seems unlikely.
