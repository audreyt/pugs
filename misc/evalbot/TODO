TODO for evalbot - please don't hesitate to implement these things (and
other that you might think of)
These tasks can be implemented in any order

 * fix utf8 issues with pugs: pugs complains about bad data when non-ascci
   chars are involved:
    18:30 < moritz> #pugs "ä"
    18:30 < exp_evalbot_test> OUTPUT[decodeUTF8': bad data: '\228'␤]

 * when the eval'ed program produces no output, the evalbots should return
   .perl.say of the last return value (if possible)

 * Evalbot for perl6 on parrot (important: find out how to determine unsafe
   operations). p6onp can be found in languages/perl6/ of the parrot
   repository

 * Evalbot for nqp (that should be quite easy to do since nqp doesn't
   support unsafe operations yet). nqp can be found in languages/nqp/ of
   the parrot repository
