Here is the parrot regexp test suite.
It would be nice to integrate it with ours.
With minimal changes, so it is easily updated from parrot.

pge is t/compilers/pge from parrot 0.4.6 release.

Actually, at least part of this has been done already.
There is a p6regex/regex_tests, driven by a p6regex.t.
Unfortunately this regexp_test is currently a hand edited mutant.
It would be nice if p6regex.t were taught which tests to skip,
and how to massage the data.
Like pge/p6regex/01-regex.t does.
So we can easily stay in sync with parrot.

There also might be one or two other files which could be imported.
Perhaps pge/p6regex/syntax_errors.t.
