This module converts T2 schema objects to Perl6::Class objects.

What on earth is T2, you might be asking?

T2 is a re-modelling of the Tangram::Schema structure, as used by the
Tangram Object/Relational mapping system, and the complementary but
independant Class::Tangram accessor generator package.  Using T2 you
can convert Class::Tangram classes to T2::Schema objects, and using
this module you can then convert them to Perl6::MetaModel objects.
