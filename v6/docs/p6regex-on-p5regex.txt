Perl6regex on Perl5regex

### Note: This Document is a Draft

"Perl6regex-on-Perl5regex" is a "Perl 6 regex engine" that uses Perl 5 regexes to implement the matching, and Perl 5 code to implement the OO "Match" structure.

The implementation so far is compatible with Perl 5.8.8.

The compilation is implemented as follows:

- a regex Grammar is run on the regex source code, and returns an AST
- ...

The mini-language is implemented like this:

op-list
...

Safe-backtracking is implemented with 'local' inside Perl 5 regex (docs: perlre)
...

    Itâ€™s easy, if verbose, to overcome the limitation: if you use local to assign values, they will disappear on backtracking. But then they also disappear at the end of the match. So what you do is combine the two: while you try to match, you put things into dynamically scoped storage; once the match has succeed but before it is finished, you save them for posterity.

    my %found;
    {
        my %pad;
        $string =~ /
            (?: (quick|slow) \s+    (?{ local $pad{speed}  = $^N  }) )
            (?: (brown|blue) \s+    (?{ local $pad{color}  = $^N  }) )?
            (?: (brown\s+fox)       (?{ local $pad{animal} = $^N  }) )
            (?{ %found = %pad })
        /xms;
    }

    That should work. Pretty? Not exactly.

  our $x = 0;
  my $result;
  "aaaaa" =~ m/^
    (?:
      .
      (?{ local $x = $x + 1 })
    )*
    aa
    (?{ $result = $x })
  $/x;
  print $result;  # 3
