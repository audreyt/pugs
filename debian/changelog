pugs (6.2.10-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added libghc6-plugins-dev build dependency to enable haskell eval support.
  * Added libparrot-dev build dependency to enable runtime evaluation of
    parrot code as well as the parrot backend for running Perl 6 code
    (-BParrot)
  * Removed dependency to pugs from pugs-modules to remove a circular
    dependnecy (Closes: #340022).
  * Use (= ${Source-Version}) instead of (>= ${Source-Version}) in the
    dependency from pugs to pugs-modules.
  * Backported some recent changes for Makefile.PL from svn to the last
    release so that pugs will work well with parrot. This involved removing
    Makefile.PL changes from the 30cabal patch.
  * Changed my Maintainer address.

pugs (6.2.10-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Renamed 30includedirs.dpatch to 30cabal.dpatch and added some more changes
    that should make installing libghc6-pugs-dev finally work.
  * Removed libghc6-plugins-dev build-dep. It isn't in sid yet anyway.

pugs (6.2.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Build-Depend on libyaml-perl, libtest-tap-model-perl,
    libtest-tap-htmlmatrix-perl, libcompress-bzip2-perl. They are needed for
    smoking.
  * Use smoke-pugs instead of a simple Harness test.
  * Removed environment hook for not sending smoke results from debian/rules.
    PUGS_BUILD_OPTS can handle that now.
  * Suggest perl and spidermonkey-bin needed by -BJS and -BPerl5.
