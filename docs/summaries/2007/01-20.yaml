        summary: |-
          When we last looked at this thread, a subthread discussing Euclidean versus
          conventional definitions of modulus was underway.  The original thread
          started when Luke Palmer asked for a clear definition of when math should
          use floating points and when it should be integer-based.
          
          The subthread was further expanded, with TSa suggesting that all rounding
          functions such as floor, round and trunc take an optional second argument
          which defines the jump size.  TSa also proposed a number of division
          function pairs, such as `fdiv` and `fmod` for flooring division and modulus,
          or `tdiv` and `tmod` for truncating division and modulus.  Smylers felt
          that this would introduce far too many functions in to the Perl core,
          given that few people would use them.  Smylers felt that it was more
          appropriate to have them as modules.  Jonathan Lang added that it was
          unlikely anyone would need multiple definitions of division and modulus
          at any given time, so modules made sense.  The only question he saw was
          which definition was default, the mathematically elegant one or the
          industry standard one.
          
          Meanwhile, the main thread was revived when TSa replied to Luke Palmer's
          question of whether 1 is different from 1.0.  TSa wanted 1 to be an Int
          and 1.0 to be a Num.  There was some discussion with Jonathan Lang over
          the relationship between Int and Num, specifically which one `does` the
          other.

        summary: |-
          Earlier,
          Jerry Gay created ticket <rt://perl/41237> to address an item in
          DEPRECATED.pod about PMC Class name IDs.  He felt that either it
          should use one syntax or the other, but not both.
          
          Allison Randal preferred eliminating the dot in classname IDs.
          Matt Diephouse, on the other hand, liked the dot.  Klaas-Jan Stol
          added that the dot indicates that it is PIR not pure PASM.
          
          Allison thought that if Matt used it to disambiguate between types and
          local variables, it was a matter of sigils.  She asked why put sigils
          on types instead of putting them in variables, and if a dot was the
          ideal sigil for types.
          
          Patrick R. Michaud also spoke out in favor of the dot.

        subject: 'Global Variables in tools/build/ops2pm.pl:  What is their rationale? Could they be refactored?'
        summary: |-
          James Keenan wondered if he should look at refactoring `tools/build/ops2pm.pl`.
          Following his successful refactor of `pmc2c.pl`, he has had requests to
          look at other build tools.  His primary suggestion was to eliminate
          global variables, but first he hoped to hear suggestions from people who
          had worked on the file, in case there was a reason for the global variables.
          
          Jerry Gay felt that the global variables were a result of lax coding
          practices early in the project.  He agreed with refactoring.

        summary: |-
          In ticket <rt://perl/41266>, Allison Randal made a note to consider
          object instantiation as a method call on a class object instead of
          an opcode on a type ID.  Kevin Tew voiced his support for the idea.

        summary: |-
          In ticket <rt://perl/41267>, Jerry Gay proposed that the `clip` directory
          be renamed as `draft` because the directory is now being used for drafts
          rather than notes.
