2007/05/07      Release of version 0.4.0 of runpugs/Web::Terminal
==============================================================================

NAME
    runpugs: a web teminal for interactive pugs 
    Web::Terminal: library for building a web terminal for interactive shells

INSTALLATION
    * To install, copy all folders to your web root
    (e.g. ~/apache on feather, or /var/www elsewhere)
    Rename html folder if required (e.g. htdocs -> html or public_html)
    * Start the terminal server script (bin/termserv3.pl) 
    * To run, simply point your browser to /runpugs/ 

DESCRIPTION
    runpugs has two main components: 
    -a mod_perl script (/perl/runpugs3.pl) which uses an html template
    (/data/runpugs_async3.html). The latter calls the runpugs.css stylesheet from
    /htdocs/runpugs.css. The script is called from /htdocs/runpugs/index.html
    -a server (/bin/termserv3.pl) which handles the interactive pugs sessions and communicates with
    the mod_perl script. The pugs sessions stay alive for some time (currently 10') if
    left inactive.

    This version has some AJAX goodness and runs under mod_perl.
    The entrypoint is /htdocs/runpugs/index.html, which calls /perl/runpugs3.pl

   The underlying library, Web/Terminal, can in principle be used for any
   interactive shell, not just pugs. So we could have runpython :-)
   See the POD for more info.
