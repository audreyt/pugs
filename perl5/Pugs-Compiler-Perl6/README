NAME
    v6-pugs - an experimental Perl 6 implementation

SYNOPSIS
    Command line:

        $ perl -Ilib lib/v6.pm -e ' for 1,2,3 -> $x { say $x }'

    Compile-only:

        $ perl -Ilib lib/v6.pm --compile-only -e ' <hello>.say; '

    Script or module:

        # file: hello_world.pl
        use v6-pugs;
        "hello, world".say;

        $ perl hello_world.pl

DESCRIPTION
    The "v6-pugs" module is a front-end to the experimental Perl6-to-Perl5
    compiler.

    The current state of this compiler implementation only provides a small
    sample of Perl 6 syntax and semantics.

  Other Perl 6 implementations
    The Pugs/Haskell Perl 6 is currently the most complete implementation.
    Pugs currently has some issues with Perl 5 interoperability.

    Parrot Perl 6 is the best performing implementation by far. The Parrot
    implementation is currently at a comparable state as v6.pm.

    Although running "v6-pugs" requires the installation of a lot of Perl 5
    modules, it is completely independent of Pugs or Parrot.

REQUIREMENTS
    - The source file header must be valid perl5 *and* perl6 code.

    This is a valid header:

        #!/usr/bin/perl
        use v6-pugs;

    * it executes perl5

    * perl5 will call the "v6.pm" module.

    This is an invalid header:

        #!/usr/bin/pugs
        use v6;

    * it tells perl5 to execute "/usr/bin/pugs".

    * it tells perl5 that Perl v6.0.0 required.

    - The "Pugs::Compiler::Rule" module must be properly installed.

    An improperly installed "Pugs::Compiler::Rule" module would prevent the
    Perl 6 compiler from bootstrapping.

    If that is the case, running "Makefile.PL" and "make" in
    "Pugs::Compiler::Rule" should fix the problem.

    - The perl5 executable must have PMC support.

    PMC support is required for loading precompiled Perl 6 files.

    If you see the error below, it may happen that your perl was compiled
    without PMC support.

      Can't locate object method "compile" via package "Pugs::Compiler::Perl6"
