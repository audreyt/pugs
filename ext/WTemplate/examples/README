WTemplate Examples
------------------

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This directory contains two examples. helloworld.pl (with
helloworld.tpl) is a command line based example, you don't
need to install it, just run it with Perl 6 / Pugs.

The other is template.cgi (with example.tpl). It's a CGI
application. Setup your favourite web server to run it.

If you have Apache, add this virtual host setting to your
httpd.conf, with example.org and /path/to/pugs changed to your
local settings:

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName wtemplate.example.org
    DocumentRoot /path/to/pugs/ext/WTemplate/
    ScriptAlias /cgi-bin /path/to/pugs/ext/WTemplate/examples/
    <Location />
        Allow from all
    </Location>
</VirtualHost>

After that, just connect to
  http://wtemplate.examples.org/template.cgi
for testing it.

Conclusion
~~~~~~~~~~

Web programming is coming to Perl 6.
