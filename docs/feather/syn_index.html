<h2><a name="Feather">Synopses on Feather</a></h2>

<p>The Synopsis documents are to be taken as the formal 
specification for Perl 6 implementations, while still 
being reference documentation for Perl 6, like 
<I>Programming Perl</I> is for Perl 5. Note that while 
these documents are considered ``formal
specifications'', they are still being subjected to the
rigours of cross-examination through implementation.
In other words, they may change slightly or radically. 
But the expectation is that they are ``very close'' to 
the final shape of Perl 6. </p>

<p>However, this HTML version of Synopses is slightly
different in that it contains code snippets from
the Pugs test suite. In other words, We have divided the .t files in the Pugs
test suite into pieces and inserted every resulting 
snippet after the corresponding paragraph of the Synopses.
The job was done by the Perl 5 script util/smartlinks.pl
living in the Pugs source tree. And all the web pages listed
below are updated every <I>one</I> hour with the latest Synopses
and Pugs test suite from their respective SVN repositories.
Thanks to the cron program on feather. ;-)</p>
<p>When we say ``S05'', we mean ``spec'' as well as ``synopsis''.</p>

<p>Perl5 users may also find it usefult to review this as well:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/docs/Perl6/Perl5/Differences.pod">Differences Between Perl and Perl6</a></li>
</ul>
<!-- It would be great if this system could convert Differences.pod to HTML and link to that as well. -->
The Differences document is stored in <code>docs/Perl6/Perl5/Differences.pod</code> in the pugs repository,
if you'd like to make updates to it.
