# P90 (**) Eight queens problem
# 
# This is a classical problem in computer science. The objective is to place
# eight queens on a chessboard so that no two queens are attacking each other;
# i.e., no two queens are in the same row, the same column, or on the same
# diagonal.
# 
# Hint: Represent the positions of the queens as a list of numbers 1..N.
# Example: [4,2,7,3,6,8,5,1] means that the queen in the first column is in row
# 4, the queen in the second column is in row 2, etc. Use the generate-and-test
# paradigm.
