Linking SQL::Routine::SQLBuilder statically or dynamically with other

the terms and conditions of the GPL cover the whole combination.  As a
special exception, the copyright holders of SQL::Routine::SQLBuilder give
you permission to link SQL::Routine::SQLBuilder with independent files,

and distribute the resulting combined work under terms of your choice,
provided that every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a complete
copy of the source code of SQL::Routine::SQLBuilder (the version of
SQL::Routine::SQLBuilder used to produce the combined work), being
distributed under the terms of the GPL plus this exception.  An independent
file is a file which is not derived from or based on
SQL::Routine::SQLBuilder, and which is fully useable when not linked to
SQL::Routine::SQLBuilder in any form.

Any versions of SQL::Routine::SQLBuilder that you modify and distribute
must carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the
date of any changes, in addition to preserving this original copyright
notice and other credits.  SQL::Routine::SQLBuilder is distributed in the

to distribute, because that is a practical way of suggesting improvements
to the standard version.
