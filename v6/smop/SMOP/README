SMOP version 0.01
=================

This module provides access to the SMOP runtime from Perl 5. It still
doesn't interoperate in a way to provide callbacks, therefore you
cannot exchange continuations from SMOP to p5.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES
