= Pugs Modules Directory
===============================================================================

- What is this directory?

This directory is meant to be a temporary holding place for both perl6 module 
ports of perl5 modules, and any new perl6 modules people might want to write.

Eventually all that you see here will end up on 6PAN.

- Do these modules work in Pugs?

Yes. Each module must come with unit tests and compiles with Pugs.

- What are those modules good for?

It is our hope that having a number of modules, each with their own test suites, 
will later serve as a kind of integration test for the more advanced features 
of Pugs and Perl 6.

Also the act of porting perl5 modules helps to raise questions about how certain
things will be accomplished in Perl 6 and helps to expose some of the darker 
corners of the Perl 6 spec; this has proven to be a good way to help the
perl6-language group in the development of the specification.

- How can I contribute?

Pick a module, port it, ask for a commit bit on perl6-compiler or
irc.freenode.net #perl6, and upload it. 

- What modules should I port?

Whatever you like. There are no restrictions nor expectations.

- Is there a How-To document for porting to perl6?

Yes, see docs/other/porting_howto for some ideas.
