This directory contains explorations of various Synopses as Perl and
Haskell code.

Much of the code and pseudo-code in here is based on Rod Adam's S29.
There is also some exploration of Junctions here by metaperl.

As far as the S29 translation to Perl goes, this has been restructured
slightly based on my own experience and some ideas from Haskell.  For
instance, there is a "Map" class, from which Array, Hash and Set can
descend.  Note there is also a more complete (but still yet not
working) version of Set at http://freepan.org/mugwump/Set (check out
with svn, drop me a note on IRC for commit access).

Also, I s/Perl6:://'ed the module names, on the "You're Soaking in it"
principle.

Lots of the Math:: methods probably would be better defined on a set
of classes like Haskell's "Number", "Integral", "Rational", etc types,
once we get the class structure for the core scalar types nailed down.
There is a nice venn diagram of these types in
http://www.cs.ou.edu/~rlpage/fpclassCurrent/textbook/haskell.shtml
 - in fact, that's the diagram that fully convinced me that classical
inheritance just doesn't work ;-).  I've cut out the diagram and put
it in number-types.png in this directory.
