# P85 (**) Graph isomorphism
# 
# Two graphs G1(N1,E1) and G2(N2,E2) are isomorphic if there is a bijection f:
# N1 -> N2 such that for any nodes X,Y of N1, X and Y are adjacent if and only
# if f(X) and f(Y) are adjacent.
# 
# Write a predicate that determines whether two graphs are isomorphic. Hint: Use
# an open-ended list to represent the function f.
