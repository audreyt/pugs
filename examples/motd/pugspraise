a love letter to the Cabal
a "Good Morning" to a sleepy programmers' community
known to clean up nicely in the shower
a coffee-cup thrown against the wall
sensitive (to semantic, pragmatic, and cultural context)
a marvel
a "Hello Perl!" from Haskell
test driven
"Perl6, now!"
a good thing
going great shakes
proof of the concept of a perly functional language
a grab-bag of new ways to shoot yourself in the foot
