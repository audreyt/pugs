Math::Basic is part of the Perl 6 prelude.  See S29.

There is also a Math::Basic in misc/Perl-MetaModel/.
The two may merge with time.

The current emphasis of this module is to avoid breaking pugs, while
perhaps becoming the first external module used by Prelude.pm.

As part of the prelude, perhaps this does not belong here in ext/?
