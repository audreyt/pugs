KindaPer6 specification

- compilable with MP6, only until KP6 bootstraps
  - MP6 spec is now frozen

- pluggable, maybe hot pluggable:
  grammar, object system, and the workflow itself

  The initial default grammar engine could be reused from MP6  
  Parrot backend could use TGE/PGE
  Perl5 backend could use PCR, MO, Moose


# Differences from MiniPerl6

- assignment with '='

- inheritance


# Wish list

- macros


# Extensibility

KP6 extensibility should make it is possible to implement Perl6 using it.
Some test cases could be (as long as the backend supports it):

- 'my' subroutines

- lexical grammar changes, such as
  my multi infix:<+> ...

- 'coro'

- junctions
