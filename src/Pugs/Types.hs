Find the \'difference\' between two types in the given class tree (for MMD
purposes and such).

Identical types (that exist in the class tree) produce 0. Compatible types
will produce a small positive number representing their distance.
Incompatible will produce a distance larger
than any two compatible types. If one (or both) of the types doesn't exist in
the tree, the result is a very large number.

{-|
Autothreading of comparisons between junctive types.

Just as autothreading over value junctions will perform an operation on all
junction elements and combine the results back into a junction, this function
autothreads some type comparison over all the possible type permutations,
then combines the results using two user-specified /functions/.

E.g. if we want to check whether the type @(Int|Str)@ is a @Num@, we first
check whether @Int@ is a @Num@ (@True@), then check whether @Str@ is a num
(@False@), then combine the results using the specified disjunctive combiner
(in this case Haskell's @(||)@). The result is thus @True@.

Take two inheritance chains produced by 'findList', and determine how
\'compatible\' the first one is with the second.

Compatible types will produce a number indicating how distant they are.
Incompatible types produce a negative number indicating how much the base type
would need to be relaxed. If one (or both) types doesn't exist in the tree, a 
large negative number is produced

E.g.:

* comparing @Int@ and @Int@ will produce 0

* comparing @Scalar@ and @String@ will produce 1

* comparing @Num@ and @Scalar@ will produce -2

* comparing @Blorple@ and @Method@ will produce -999 (or similar)
