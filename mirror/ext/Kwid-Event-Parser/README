 Kwid::Event::Parser v0.0.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a very basic Kwid parser using an event based API (modeled 
after XML SAX parsers). Much of the code is directly swiped from the
Pod::Event::Parser module, just modified to understand Kwid source
instead of POD source.

The purpose for this module is quite simple. We have plenty of Kwid
documents in the Pugs distribution, and currently no means to parse
or display them. The Perl 5 Kwid parser should be available soon, but
why have it in Perl 5, when you can have it in Perl 6 ;)
