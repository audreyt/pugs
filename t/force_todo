# For releases, we used to TODO all failing tests.
# Because this wasn't that easy at times, we have now a more central approach:
# Test.pm reads this file and checks, if there are some tests to forcetodo.
# 
# Example: To forcetodo tests 13-15 and 42 of t/foo/bar.t, uncomment the
# following line:
#   t/foo/bar.t 13 14 15 42
# 
# (Side note: Lines matching /^#/ are comments. Be careful to only use " " as
# delimiter, not tabs or multiple spaces or whatever.)
