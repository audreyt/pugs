 *
 * MESSAGE is the only low-level definition on a responder interface,
 * everything else is handled the same way in the low-level as it is
 * in the high-level.
 *
 * REFERENCE is called every time an object is referenced in some

 *
 * RELEASE is called every time an reference is released.
 *
 * This doesn't mean that every object need to be refcounted, but
 * without it it would be impossible to implement a refcount gc. Both
 * methods return the input pointer.
