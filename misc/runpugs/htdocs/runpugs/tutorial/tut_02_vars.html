The Perl 6 Language
Variables
As in Perl 5, three container types:
# Scalars hold one value
my $name = "Jonathan";
# Arrays hold many values
my @fave_foods = "Curry", "Pizza", "Beef";
# Hashes hold many key/value pairs
my %opinions = (
Perl => ‘Awesome’,
Vista => ‘Suckful’,
Ale => ‘Tasty’
);

type "my @animals = <dog cat mouse>" to continue
