Feel free to use wikipedia Talk style if you know it.

== Purpose ==

This directory was created to address these problems:
 - No one knows what the current state of the project is.
 - It is difficult to determine what people are working on.
 - No one knows what needs to be done.
 - No one knows how they can help.
 - No one knows where we are going, or how we are to get there.
Perhaps this is a slight overstatement.  But only a slight one.

The project management approach of pugs has been anarchistic
development.  A flooding algorithm for planning (everyone working on
whatever development path/aspects appeals to them); active and rapid
development; continuous communication; and a low commit threshold
("don't worry about breaking the build, just commit, and we'll fix
it").  This approach worked well when development was rapid, there
was a clear primary development thrust, and an active community with
an up to date and detailed organizational memory.

For several reasons (we haven't been able to pay audreyt to work full
time being a key one), the main thrust has slowed, the overall pace of
development has slowed, and the community has become smaller, less
active, and less tightly informed.  This created negative feedback.
It became harder to tell what to work on, easier to get stuck, and
harder to be motivated.  Thus further slowing development and
shrinking the active community.

I created this directory to increase project transparency.  To make it
easier for people to see what needs doing, and why.  This is not a
full solution, but will hopefully mitigate the negative feedback loop,
helping us make less slow progress until things pick up again.
