This is the placeholder for v6-Onion.

v6-Onion (On6) is a Perl 6 compiler written in Perl 6

On6 is bootstrapped with v6-KindaPerl6 (KP6).
Unlike KP6, the On6 source code can use plain Perl 6.
However, there are some language features that On6 should probably not use,
because they are hard to support in some backends.

Otherwise, On6 is the same project as KP6, and it follows the same roadmap.
See v6/docs/kp6-roadmap.pod
