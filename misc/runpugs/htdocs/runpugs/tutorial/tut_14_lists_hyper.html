The Perl 6 Language
Hyper Operators
Used to perform an operation per
element of an array
This is similar to a loop that takes
elements 0 from @a and @b, adds them
and puts the result in element 0 of @c
Gives permission for the operation on
different elements to be parallelized =>
good for the Concurrent Future
my @c = @a >>+<< @b;
