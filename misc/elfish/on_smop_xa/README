This is the start of an elf-based emitter for smop.

It was intended as a "quick demo", but writing it was interrupted.
Rather than continuing to sit on the code, I check in a snapshot.
I believe the next step was to be an env var to gather block decls.

The plan was to eventually move this to the smop directory.
