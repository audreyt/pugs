                                Muldis::DB
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Muldis::DB version 0.0.1 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-DB-0.0.1.tar.gz.  Muldis::DB version 0.0.1 for Perl 6 is not
    released at this time, if ever, since it is currently released only as
    part of the Perl6-Pugs project (in its ext/Muldis-DB/ subdirectory),
    which sets its own less frequent release schedule.  The rest of this
    Changes entry refers only to the Perl 5 version.

    * New code file versions are: DB.pm and AST.pm and Validator.pm and
    Example.pm 0.0.1.

    * The primary purpose of this release is to re-license Muldis::DB under
    actual free software licenses, specifically version 3 of the GPL family
    of licenses, which the Free Software Foundation formally published on
    2007 June 29th.  By contrast, the previous Muldis::DB releases were
    under an expiring proprietary license, with just the promise of a free
    re-license to come.  TODO: STATE ADDITION OF LICENSE FILES TO DISTRO.

    * This release also includes a collection of small documentation
    updates and fixes, such as the following:  We now use the official
    typography for the names 'TTM' and 'D' and such.  Added a DOCUMENTATION
    READING ORDER section to the README file.  Added the 2007 June 4th
    Muldis::DB namespace registration (to the official CPAN module list)
    notice to the Changes file.  Updated parts of DB.pm and Copying.pod
    concerning licensing matters.  This release has no code changes.

    * Muldis::DB version 0.0.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-DB-0.0.0.tar.gz.  Muldis::DB version 0.0.0 for Perl 6 is not
    released at all.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to the
    Perl 5 version.

    * This is the first release of the Perl 5 Muldis-DB distribution, and
    the first release of any distribution to contain Perl 5 modules named
    Muldis::DB::\w+.

    * This is the initial file manifest:

    * Initial code file versions are: DB.pm and AST.pm and Validator.pm and
    Example.pm and PhysType.pm and Operators.pm 0.0.0.

    * As of this release, Muldis-DB is officially in pre-alpha development
    status.  A lot of documentation and functionality is present, but a lot
    isn't.  What is mostly done is the higher level documentation plus an
    alpha-quality but fundamentally stable public API implementation.  What
    is mostly undone is the reference engine implementation, the test
    suite, and documentation of the API details.  What is already present
    should be sufficient to begin study of Muldis-DB such that it can
    actually be put to use within the next few weeks or months as Muldis-DB
    is fleshed out.  Also, it should be possible now to start writing code
    that uses or extends it.
