 Pod::Stream::Parser v0.0.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a very basic POD stream parser modeled after XML SAX parsers. 
My goal is to have a working POD parser for Pugs which can parse the 
perl6 Synposis POD documents. 

Not the greatest reason in the world, but thats about all I have 
for now :)

And of course the act of writing this will hopefully produce a number
of tests for specific features as well (already is has produced a few).
