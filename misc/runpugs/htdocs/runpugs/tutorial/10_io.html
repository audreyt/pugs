<h2>Reading Entire Files</h2>
Reading in an entire file is now as simple as<br/>
<pre>
my $file_content = slurp("filename.txt");
</pre>
Or to get an array with an element for each line in the file</br>
<pre>
my @lines = slurp("filename.txt");
</pre>
Reads the whole file in one go - very handy, but 
be careful when dealing with big files!<br/>
