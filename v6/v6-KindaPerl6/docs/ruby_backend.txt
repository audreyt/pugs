kp6 ruby backend

src/KindaPerl6/Runtime/Ruby
src/KindaPerl6/Visitor/Emit/Ruby.pm

TODO:
- add ruby backend option to script/kp6
Emit/Ruby.pm is currently a copy of Perl5.pm,
so the ruby backend should generate working kp6-p5 code.
- walk though Emit/Ruby.pm, deciding, creating, and documenting runtime apis.
- do Runtime/Ruby.  Should be much simpler and smaller than Runtime/Perl5/.

LATER:
- create script/kp6.pl? a p6 version of the p5 script/kp6.
- rename ruby backend to ruddy (after acceptance).


To get Emit/Ruby.pm built.
  # get svn file timestamps correct
  rm -rf v6-KindaPerl6/compiled
  svn up
  # make
  perl Makefile.PL
  make kp6_mp6
