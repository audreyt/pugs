'v6' is a Perl 6 compiler written in plain perl6.

This is not the perl5 v6-alpha, see perl5/Pugs-Compiler-Perl6 for that.


There are currently 3 active subprojects:

- v6-MiniPerl6 is a subset of Perl 6 used to bootstrap the full Perl 6.

- v6-KindaPerl6 is a full Perl 6 implementation, currently written mostly in MiniPerl6.

- smop is a C implementation of the Perl 6 runtime.


Inactive projects are under misc/
