This is intended to an example of how to parse Apache logs in the "combined"
log format.

However currently it doesn't work at all, that's why it's not yet in
examples/.

Usage is:
cat /var/log/apache2/access.log | pugs logan.pl

the current output is:

invalid aliased subrule at /home/moritz/pugs/perl5/Pugs-Compiler-Rule/lib/Pugs/Emitter/Rule/Perl5/Ratchet.pm line 653.

any idea what's wrong?
