"Perl 6 over Perl 6" Roadmap


Introduction

"Long-term Projects" are 1 year or more long. 
Long-term projects have several Phases or Versions.

"Short-term Projects" are at most 3 months long. 
Short-term Projects may keep being maintained, or may be obsoleted.

Each "Phase" should describe a major project. Ideally, it should be 2-3 months of work with a clear end product and a clear goal.

Each "Milestone" should describe a 4-6 week project that results in a major new feature or functionality. 
The goal of phases and milestones here is really just to break the project down into bite-sized pieces that regular hackers can get their heads around.

Inside each milestone, we should have an ordered list of tasks that should each take no more than 1-3 days of effort. (Sometimes this is impossible, but if it can get done for the next/current Phase, we'll give hackers a good place to start)


Long-term Projects 

  Parrot "perl6" (Perl 6 over Parrot)

  Pugs "pugs" (Perl 6 over Haskell, Perl 5, and C)

  Perl 6 over Perl 6

While Parrot and Pugs are more or less "monolithical", 6-in-6 on the other hand is being built of many small projects.


Short-term Project examples

  Perl6::Rules

  PGE

  TGE

  lrep

  Moose

  Pugs::Compiler::Rule

  v6.pm

  MiniPerl6

  KindaPerl6

  Perl-6.0.0-STD


Perl 6 over Perl 6

Current state of the technology

  "Perl-6.0.0-STD" 
    provides a grammar and parser routines written in "full Perl 6";
      Perl 6 over Perl 6 should be able to use this grammar.

  "pugs" can parse a "cheated" Perl-6.0.0-STD grammar.

  "v6.pm" can parse most of "Perl-6.0.0-STD". 
    v6.pm and pugs share the same regex engine (Pugs::Compiler::Rule).

  "KindaPerl6" provides a working bootstrapped compiler. The grammar, the parser engine, and most of the runtime are written in Perl 6.

Extending KindaPerl6

  Architecture

    migrate Perl 5 runtime to MiniPerl6, for reusability
      object metamodel

    merge the regex parser into the main compiler

  Backends

-- Perl 5
-- Parrot (Perl6-Parrot, PIR)
-- Perl6-Haskell (Pugs)
-- JVM (Groovy, Java, bytecode) 
-- Javascript (plain javascript, PIL2JS)
-- pypy (RPython)

Phase I - bootstrap (MiniPerl6)


Milestone 1: Architecture

Milestone 2: v6.pm bootstrap for compiler.

  Improve v6.pm to host the compiler...
    Be specific. What does it need?

Milestone 3: Implement compiler

    Break this down into 5-6 tasks




Milestone 4: Self-hosting compiler


    Break this down into 5-6 tasks



---

Bonus projects: (Not required to complete Phase 1)

-- compile to a language supported by the Parrot VM

-- "use"
-- Type system

- Bonus milestones

-- subroutine prototypes

-- compiler front-end written in Perl 6
-- usable as a "v6.pm" plugin
-- optionally compile to "MiniPerl6" level (faster, smaller, but less features)
-- parse Perl6-STD
-- use ext/Test.pm
-- integrated into the smoke system
-- debugger
-- interactive mode

__END__
------------------------------------------------



** no particular order, yet - cut and pasted from the TODO

- private method/sub/accessor
- signatures with optional, named, slurpy arguments
- user-clonable closures
    - $closure.clone - creates new pads with copies of lexicals

+ try(), eval()
+ 'Code' closure objects
+ 'Capture' objects
+ classes, methods, at compile-time
+ short-circuiting <&&>, <||>, <?? !!> (require macros, or laziness)

- 'let' variables
- 'our' variables
- CATCH blocks

- method hyperization is untested

- immutables - Set, Seq, Bag

- traits
    - is context, rw, readonly
- containers, but no laziness, no slices
    - hash and array are under refactoring
    - P6opaque
    - GLOBAL importation should be lexical
    - method not found falls back to sub call
    - lvalue methods (rw)
    - call context
- type system
- for-loop, map, with several arguments
- (FIXED) begin-blocks with side-effects
- subroutine calls, data, are incompatible with perl 5
- no 'use v5'
- declare our/state/temp/constant things    

- missing GLOBAL::import() at compile-time
- 'our $x' should compile to 'my $x ::= $Pkgname::x'
- 'use GLOBAL $x' should compile to 'my $x ::= $GLOBAL::x'

- perl6-land 'use'
- translate the COMPILER package to mp6
- translate Pad.pm and Type.pm to mp6

- create an AST node for INIT/END

BEGIN blocks:

- logging of array/hash element modifications is not implemented
- binding to Value is not emitted

- Method and Class doesn't have '.perl'

Bugs:

- missing compile-time methods

- compile-time does not import GLOBAL - 'say' doesn't work inside BEGIN blocks

- grammar: 'undefine($v)' is not parsed
- structure binding/assign is untested

Roles:

- (FIXED) possible implementation:
    $Obj->{Role_bool} = sub { 1 };
  at runtime:
    $Obj->{Role_bool} && $Obj->{Role_bool}() || $Obj->bool()
- problem: objects based on p5-array (Array), p5-code (Code)
    - p5-land objects will only have Moose-based roles

Perl5 compatibility:

- mark closure blocks as p5 or p6 (kp6/mp6)
  
Problems running the Perl6 test suite:
  
- kp6 requires a 'compilation unit' declaration
- '&&', '||' operators don't short circuit
- (FIXED) 'if', 'sub' require ';'
- prefix and postfix:<++> not implemented
- 'use' doesn't accept parameters: use lib ".";
- parameter list error in:
    if defined $var { ...
  requires:
    if defined($var) { ...
- no END blocks

Visitor modules:

- deprecated modules:
    KindaPerl6::Visitor::LexicalSub
    KindaPerl6::Visitor::CreateEnv

- MetaClass.pm
  - add class variables
  - test bootstrap
  - roles
  - alias Class::MOP's 'meta' to 'HOW'
    ---
    package Class::MOP::Class;
    sub meta { Class::MOP::Class->initialize(blessed($_[0]) || $_[0]) }  
    ---
  - create BUILD, BUILDALL

- OUTER namespace
- ROUTINE
- tail-calls

For later:

- desugar blocks into real subroutines, in support for the parrot backend
  - fixed by now, using p6parrot as an intermediate language

- desugar closures into simple subroutines, in support for the C backend

- temp/state desugaring, for perl5

- circular prelude

- 6-on-6 design
  - full-ast
