Style suggestions: Say *why* things are tasks.  What does completion
look like.  Perhaps phrase in milestone dialect.  Include detail.
They should *not* be "remind yourself" notes - those can go elsewhere.
Enough detail that someone can, cold, () understand what it means, ()
judge whether they have the skills to do it, () estimate the effort
required, () have confidence if they start, the effort won't be
completely missing the point and wasted.

Vision
----------------------------------------

misc/winter_jig was started 2008-02-24, and envisioned as lasting one
month, resulting in the creation of a Perl 6 implementation sufficient
for people to start writing p6 code.

Specifically, that the langauge coverage, speed of compilation, speed
of execution, correctness and debuggability, would make it possible to
start developing large oo p6 subsystems.  And that doing so would have
greater appeal than working directly in backend languages (eg, p5, ruby).

So the immediate objective is to get a sufficiently working parser, a
simple emitter, and a simple and fast backend(s) which just implement
the backend language's semantics, rather than stretching to be true to
p6.  p5 and/or ruby are likely backends, the first because of local
culture, the second for it's power and ability to easily support more
p6 semantics.

So the the pieces are
 parser -> ast -> emitter -> backend code + minimal backend runtime.

Success is being able to start writing, and reasonably expect not to
get bogged down working around bugs, as has long been the case with
pugs.

  module BigThing {
    class JustOnePartOfMany {
      is APart;
      ...
    }
    ...
  }

Some things which folks might work on once this capability exists are:

* Continue writing the Prelude.  It's been stalled for years on "pugs
can't handle it".

* Write a p6 regex engine.  With an ast, and an emitter which assumes
an underlying but non-reentrant p5re engine.  Many/most languages have
the later, so this provides for p6 bootstrap in many places.  And for
having a single reference source for correctness.  And a platform to
start working on rx compilation, and on wizzy regex engines.

* Write more and more of a p6 implementation in p6.  At some point,
you will notice a bootstrap has occured.


============================================================
Ast's
----------------------------------------
KP6 AST:

Kp6 can dump it's ast (script/kp6 -Cast-yaml).  The result is usable,
though schema analysis and validation is unfinshed.  There is a
framework for emitters written in p5 (see emit_from_kp6_pl_generate),
and a barely started example of use.

The kp6 ast path needs a customer.  In their absence, development
focus has shifted elsewhere.  Work on a new kp6 backend has started,
and there's been no other interest, suggesting something is missing.

DEVELOPMENT PATH

Posible directions to go are:

 * Get validation working.  This could serve as a prototype for other
ast's, so disregarding the existing work is fine.

 * Flesh out the "bare p5" backend.  The design might be yanked from
pmurias's new MiniPerl6Like kp6 backend.  This could provide a "it
really works" demo.  Perhaps this would attract some interest.

VALIDATION

The schema validator turned out to be non-trivial, and is unfinished.
Current thinking is a different approach is needed.  Either convert to
XML, and use its validation tools, or convert to prolog-like terms,
and write a "quite trivial in prolog" validation predicate.

(HOLD) The p5-based schema validator, kp6_ast_validate, is on hold.
There may be an easier way to approach this.

Turns out there is at least one extra node, Pad.

The field value spec is incompletely specifies what is going on.
Plan woudl be to run the validator against ast-yaml files, and fill
in field specs based on their actual values.

(TODO) Figure out what Pad is, and add it to the schema, or remove
it from the yaml.

[QUESTION] Is there a schema doc somewhere?

(done) An ast node-and-field spec file which properly recreates the
original KindaPerl6/Ast.pm.  This does *not* include a field value
schema (which was not present in the original).


(done) A very simple transparent p5 wrapper module for ast trees.

(MILESTONE) It's as easy to access the kp6 ast as it ever will be.
Non-local and semantic work is *not* on the agenda.


----------------------------------------
RAKUDO AST:

(BLOCKED) [particle] was working on doing a yaml dump of it, but ran
out of tuits.  A hand-off to coke is possible.  cognominal has
expressed interest.  ast_rakudo/Notes.txt has an irc conversation on
the path foward.

There is an existing --target=parse , so the ast which rakudo would
expose can be eyeballed.  Nothing currently exists which can parse
that output.

[QUESTION] In dumping the ast, is it simply a format issue?  Eg,
adding yaml dumpers to parrot objects?  Or does the tree need clean-up
as well?

There is a new script which runs rakudo with --target=parse against
the pugs t/spec.  The results, only 35 of 128 files are successfully
parsed, is less than I hoped.  But I have not looked at the nature of
the failures, so they may be meaninglessly trivial, or fundamental.

*** PRIORITY:
(TODO) Look at the rakudo parse fails and get a feel for what is
happening.  This will determine how large a role rakudo might play
over the rest of March.

(TODO) Infrastructure to keep in sync.

(TODO) Create validator.  Perhaps use XML or prolog this time, rather
than custom perl?

(TODO) Simple wrapper library.


----------------------------------------
REDSIX AST:

Redsix has a ruby copy version of the pugs grammar, and so
hypothetically has the potential to do a good but non-spec parse, and
provide that ast.

A redsix ast has been one of the lower risk approaches to getting a
parse, but also a less interesting one.  It would be non-STD, and
requiring extending and debugging throwaway-code from an inactive
project.

An ast yaml dumper was started.  --yaml.  Currently, some information
is missing, as the nodes turn out to need some massage before dumping
occurs.  This was explored a bit in the "soon to be thrown away" ATerm
dumping code which was also added.

(TODO) Add ATerm-like massage to the yaml dumping, and flesh it out.

(TODO) Determine if this is needed.  While rakudo can't *run* very
much, if it can *parse* everything (can't - not clear yet why), or
almost everything, redsix can, and as fast, then we can punt this.


============================================================
Match trees
----------------------------------------

No work has been done on a match tree yaml schema.


MATCH TREE ABSTRACTION:

(TODO) Write a Match-tree schema and validator.

kqalify should be sufficiently powerful.  Look to src/perl6/Cursor5.pm.

----------------------------------------
STD5.pm SUPPORT

(WAIT) for abstraction.

(TODO) Add yaml dump to Cursor5.


============================================================
Accessible components
----------------------------------------

ACCESSIBLE INTERPRETERS

There is now a script to run p6 interpreters, without having to worry
about what directory to change into, or what executable to invoke.  It
does *not* insulate you from command line arguments, and input styles.
That's another, more difficult task.

Includes: pugs kp6 rakudo.exe rakudo.pbc redsix

(TODO) Add the v6 Perl::Compiler thing.  What is it's name?!?


ACCESSIBLE REGEX ENGINES

There is now a script to run regex implementations on a grammar and
input file, and dump the Match tree as yaml.

Currently only includes: pcr (Pugs::Compiler::Grammar).


ACCESSIBLE REGEX ENGINE (PGE):

(BLOCKED) Waiting on parrat yaml.

ACCESSIBLE REGEX ENGINE (Pugs::Compiler::Rule):

(TODO) Get a conformant search result Match-tree yaml dump.

ACCESSIBLE REGEX ENGINE (yet_another_regexp_engine):

(TODO) Determine need.  Does it have any advantages in speed or
coverage over PGE?  Or of tested-ness?  Or value in being p5?  Then
again, it may be trivially easy.
  We don't actually have PGE yet, and it's not yet clear when we will.
  It seem likely to do at least some things better than pcr.
  So this should probably go ahead. - putter 2008-Mar-06


============================================================
Frontends
----------------------------------------

src/perl6/STD.pm is the closest thing we currently have for a "real",
authoritative grammar for p6.

STD5

STD5 now has a wrapper which outputs a yaml Match tree.
Development of STD.pm and STD5 may have hit some issues.

(TODO) Explore what can be done to smooth STD.pm and STD5 development.

(HOLD) Write match-tree to whatever-ast converter.
The set of things parsed does not yet seem interesting
enough to pursue yet.


STD_red

A version of STD.pm hand translated to ruby.  Intended to be a
relatively low risk, but high manual effort, attempt to get a usably
working p6 parser.

(TODO) Continue to increase the portion of the parse tree which
generates Match()es.

(TODO) Assess the problem of some things (like assignment) not having
a "working" implementation speced in STD.pm.


See winter_jig/STD/README.


REDSIX

See redsix ast above.


============================================================
Backends
----------------------------------------
BARE PERL5 BACKEND:

(HOLD) Awaiting interest from someone, or a mission.

(done) Sketched emit_from_kp6.  *Not* runnable or run.

(TODO) Get it runnable.

[QUESTION] Can the kp6 test files be used, or do they have too many
runtime dependencies?

[QUESTION] What is a target milestone for this?  "I would be happy
rewriting yet_another_regex_engine from p5 to this dialect of p6"???
Does the non-obviousness indicate a project management thinko?
