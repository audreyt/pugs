v6::Compiler

The v6::Compiler module provides a front-end to the Perl6-in-Perl6 "bootstrapped" compiler.

The parts of the compiler that are implemented in other languages are imported as classes or objects.

For example:

  rule int { 
    \d+
    { return $/[0].as(NInt) }
  }

The 'NInt' class can be implemented using native code, and the AST can be made implementation-specific if desired.
