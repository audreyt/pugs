This is going to be in S03 (mail from Luke to p6l:
L<"http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language/22849">).
L<S03/"New operators" /Binary C<===>/>
Binary C<eqv> tests value equivalence: for two value types, tests whether they
are the same value (eg. C<1 eqv 1>); for two reference types, checks whether
they are the same reference (eg. it is not true that C<[1,2] eqv [1,2]>, but it
is true that C<\@a eqv \@a>).

Update (2005-11-13): C<eqv> is now spelled C<===>.
