=head1 NAME

Muldis::DB::Language::Ext::Temporal -
Muldis D extension for temporal data types and operators

=head1 PREFACE

This document is part of the Muldis D language specification, whose root
document is L<Muldis::DB::Language>; you should read that root document
before you read this one, which provides subservient details.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

I<This documentation is pending.>

=head2 Temporal Data Types

These non-fundamental scalar data types describe common kinds of temporal
artifacts according to modern calendars.  They come in a variety of
precisions and epochs so that users can pick one that most accurately
represents what they actually know about their data.  I<Of course, dealing
with these types in general isn't a perfect science; they stand to be
revised or rewritten.>

=over

=item C<sys.type.Temporal.Duration>

A C<Temporal.Duration> is a single amount of time, with precision to
arbitrary fractions of a second.  It is not fixed to any date or time and
is agnostic to both the calendar and whether or not a time-zone offset is
known.  Its default value is zero.  The cardinality of this type is
infinity; to define a most-generalized finite C<Temporal.Duration> subtype,
you must specify the maximum amount of time that its values may be.

=item C<sys.type.Temporal.DurationOfDays>

A C<Temporal.DurationOfDays> is the same as C<Temporal.Duration> in all
respects but that its precision is only to the whole terrestrial day.  The
cardinality of this type is infinity; to define a most-generalized finite
C<Temporal.DurationOfDays> subtype, you must specify the maximum amount of
time that its values may be.

=item C<sys.type.Temporal.DateTime>

A C<Temporal.DateTime> is a single specific time on a specific date, with
precision to arbitrary fractions of a second.  It I<does> incorporate an
explicit terrestrial time-zone offset (relative to UTC), so you use it when
you I<do know> the time-zone and it is significant (which is usually).  It
is conceptually calendar-agnostic.  The default value of
C<Temporal.DateTime> is the Perl 6 epoch, namely 2000-1-1T0:0:0 in the
Gregorian calendar, with a time-zone offset of zero.  The cardinality of
this type is infinity; to define a most-generalized finite
C<Temporal.DateTime> subtype, you must specify the earliest and latest
datetimes it includes, and also its least magnitude fraction of a second.

=item C<sys.type.Temporal.DateTimeNoTZ>

A C<Temporal.DateTimeNoTZ> is the same as C<Temporal.DateTime> in its
precision, but it I<does not> incorporate an explicit terrestrial time-zone
offset interval, and so it is conceptually ambiguous within an interval of
about 25 hours; you use it when you I<do not know> the time-zone or it is
not significant (which is not usually).  Its default value is
2000-1-1T0:0:0 in the Gregorian calendar.  Matters of its cardinality are
the same as for C<Temporal.DateTime>.

=item C<sys.type.Temporal.Date>

A C<Temporal.Date> is the same as C<Temporal.DateTime> in all respects but
that its precision is only to the whole terrestrial day.  Its default value
is 2000-1-1 in the Gregorian calendar.  The cardinality of this type is
infinity; to define a most-generalized finite C<Temporal.Date> subtype, you
must specify the earliest and latest dates it includes.

=item C<sys.type.Temporal.DateNoTZ>

A C<Temporal.DateNoTZ> is the same as C<Temporal.Date> in all respects but
that its differences correspond to the differences between
C<Temporal.DateTime> and C<Temporal.DateTimeNoTZ>.  Matters of its
cardinality are the same as for C<Temporal.Date>.

=item C<sys.type.Temporal.Time>

A C<Temporal.Time> is a single specific time that isn't on any day in
particular, and isn't part of any calendar in particular, with a precision
to arbitrary fractions of a second; its allowed range is between zero
seconds (inclusive) and 1 terrestrial day (exclusive).  It does incorporate
an explicit time-zone offset interval as per C<Temporal.DateTime>.  Its
default value is 0:0:0.  The cardinality of this type is infinity; to
define a most-generalized finite C<Temporal.Time> subtype, you must specify
its least magnitude fraction of a second.

=item C<sys.type.Temporal.TimeNoTZ>

A C<Temporal.TimeNoTZ> is the same as C<Temporal.Time> in all respects but
that its differences correspond to the differences between
C<Temporal.DateTime> and C<Temporal.DateTimeNoTZ>.  Matters of its
cardinality are the same as for C<Temporal.Time>.
