 * In this test we want to test only the smop lowlevel runtime, to do
 * that, we're going to fake a lot of features the lowlevel runtime
 * counts on. Note that it may look weird that the lowlevel runtime
 * requires some features that comes from the high-level, but it's
 * also important to realise that there's a matter of timing
 * also. Which basically means that we know that at the time we need
 * the high-level features, they will be already available.
 *
 * This test, even testing the lowlevel features of SMOP depends on
 * some features of the high-level smop.
