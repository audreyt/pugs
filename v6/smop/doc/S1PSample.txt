# this is a sample compilation of a Perl 6 class. The example code is in src-s1p/P6Meta.pm

my $interpreter;
my $scope;

# we get a get a lexical scope that should be used as the
# outer scope of each method, and the interpreter object

# first it needs to create the p6opaque, register in the namespace and
# set the how to SMOP__S1P__PurePrototypeHow


# then it needs to create the mold for the code. it should include the
# use of the capture present in $_, as we're going to create every
# method with the bindcapture signature and then going to implement
# the lexical scope population in the beggining of the block.
