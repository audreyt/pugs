    Prelude generator.

I'd do this in Perl, but presumably show escapes nasty things I didn't
think about.

Unfortunately, this doesn't put literal newlines in the output. There's a
bug in any(The Haskell Report, sec. 2.6; GHC; my understanding) regarding
strings with gaps, when beteween the gaps there is an empty line. Fixes
welcome :-)
