=head1 NAME

Perldoc::Sender - a description of how to `send' parse events

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # get a sender from a sub-class constructor, like a Parser
  my $reader = Perldoc::Reader->new( file => $filename );
  my $sender = Perldoc::Parser->new( reader => $reader );
  my $receiver = Perldoc::DOM->new();

  # either plumb it up first;
  $sender->receiver($receiver);

  $sender->send_all;

  1 while $sender->send_one;

  # or specify the receiver immediately
  $sender->send_all_to($receiver);

  1 while $sender->send_one_to($receiver);

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item B<send_to($object)>

Emits all events to the specified place.  $object must be a
(C<-E<gt>isa>) Perldoc::Receiver.  Sub-classes should provide this
method.


C<$object> straight away, or pass the next events it receives.

If you use the sub-class API provided in this module, then the events
you send will automatically be correctly balanced.  This does mean
that C<send_one()> might actually send more that one event at a time
as those extra events are inserted into the event stream.

Also, the utility functions provided by this module do not give you a
re-entrant sender.  Even the C<send_all> method cannot be safely used
re-entrantly.  That means you must not try to use the same object in
more than one stream simultaneously; wait for it to finish, you
impatient lout!  :)

Of course, you don't need to use this module to successfully send
events to C<Perldoc::Receiver> classes.  See L<Perldoc::Receiver> for more.

This module requires C<Spiffy>, and uses C<Spiffy> to create accessors
- but does not turn sub-classes of this module into C<Spiffy>
sub-classes.

=head2 SUB-CLASS API

The below method is used for sending by sub-classes of this module.

=item $self->send($event, @args)

Sends an event to the configured target.

Allowable events are;

    }

	pop @{ $self->stack };
    }
}


=over

=item B<start_document({})>

This should start the stream.  pass a hash of options.

=item B<end_document>

=item B<start_element(name, { name => "foo", ...})>

Start a L<POD::DOM::Element>.  C<name> must be set.  Note that the

=item B<end_element(name)>

Close a L<POD::DOM::Element>.
