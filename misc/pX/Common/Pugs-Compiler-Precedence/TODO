TODO file for Pugs-Compiler-Precedence

- \s{ is an expression terminator if the parser is expecting an operator

- add is-parsed to the appropriate category in op-precedence and tokenizer

- cleanup Pugs::AST::Expression in PCR (no longer used?)

- add_op() doesn't need the 'block' key

- PCP needs to return a Match object?
  (maybe a match-like object is more appropriate?)
