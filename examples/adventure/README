SYNOPSIS

This is a simple adventure written in Perl6. A fun way to learn the
new features of the language. :-)


DESCRIPTION

According to the Wikipedia, interactive fiction (which is another
name for "adventure") describes software simulating environments
in which players use text commands to control characters and influence
the environment. Works in this form can be understood as literary
narratives and as computer games. In common usage, the word refers
to text adventures, a type of adventure game with text-based input
and output.

One of the interesting things of writing an adventures, is that it
requires some knowledge of the programming language, but is not that
difficult to write (once you know a few basic concepts); and is a
fun way to learn a new language.

This work was presented at: 

    * Nordic Perl Workshop (Copenhagen, April 2007)
    * Oslo.pm techmeeting (Oslo, May 2007)
