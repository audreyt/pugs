TODO for Pugs::Compiler::Rule (PCR)

Priorities:

- add PadWalker dependency to Makefile.PL
- move files to /perl5; fix paths in Makefile.PL

- Match: .from and .to not implemented in subrules

- maybe use PadWalker for solving these problems:
  - simple closures should get the Match/self argument
  - $0, $1 should work inside the rule 

- '%var := xxx'; '@var := xxx'; %<var> := ; @<var> :=

- rule parameters 

- :P5 rules

Tests:

- backtracking control ':' 

Related projects:

- implement (optional?) PCR in pugs

- use PCR in lrep
  - merge the 'dual engine' in PCR (used by the lrep-compiled grammar)

- implement Pugs::Compiler::PILN ?
  - not a priority - p5 could load ready-made YAML from Pugs

Other:

- closures should be called on the Match object

- add a hook for compiling closures (such as pugs or a source filter)
  - cleanup any remaining source filtering

- rule documentation (shorter than S05)
- examples of use

- incomplete rule syntax (see Pugs::Compiler::Rule pod)

- Switches - none so far - all rules have :p set (only match at start of 
  text) (see Pugs::Compiler::Rule workaround)

- 'Pugs::Grammar::Rule' - old p5 code... -- 'use' in P:G:R

- more tests (port from lrep)
  
- optimization: inline code in the Engine
