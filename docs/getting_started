Getting Started with Perl 6

(This is mostly just a skeleton with a few key URLs; feel free to flesh it out,
improve the formatting etc.)


Learning Perl 6

  Unfortunately, there doesn't yet seem to be much in the way of tutorials for
  people new to Perl 6.
  
  These are a few resources you may want to try reading:
  
  * Quickref
  
  http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/docs/quickref/
  (or docs/quickref/ in your local copy)
  
  * Examples
  
  http://svn.openfoundry.org/examples/
  (or examples/ in your local copy)
  
  * The Synopses
  
  http://svn.perl.org/perl6/doc/trunk/design/syn/  (official repo)
  http://dev.perl.org/perl6/doc/synopsis.html      (HTML versions)
  
  * perl6-language
  
  http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language
