TODO list for KindaPerl6

- finish kp6-spec
- lexical subs and classes; metamodel interface; begin blocks; containers

Visitor modules:

- add variable declarations collector
  - move variable declarations to the start of each block

- move subroutine declarations into variables
  LexicalSub.pm
  - add 'our' subs to the namespace, if there is one
  - recurse into expressions and blocks
  - verify the interface with native p5 subs

- add metamodel API

For later:

- desugar blocks into real subroutines, in support for the parrot backend

- desugar closures into simple subroutines, in support for the C backend

- temp/state desugaring, for perl5
