To install Buildbot on a unix-y system, you should just have to run setup.sh.
The master.cfg is the configuration file for the master, and extensions.py
contains the definitions for smoke testing, which is used by master.cfg.
Currently, there is a buildbot master that is active from ~8AM to ~9PM PDT,
hosted at:
http://www.unobe.com:8010/
It only has one slave system (itself), which is a Mac Mini running OSX PPC,
and builds Pugs once a day. E-mail unobe@cpan.org if you have any questions
about that buildbot master.
