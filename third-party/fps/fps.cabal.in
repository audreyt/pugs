-- -DLOOPNOACC_FUSION
-- -DLOOPUP_FUSION
-- -DLOOPU_FUSION

-- If you have a ghc 6.5 newer than 06/06/06, try unsetting this It will
-- use a faster foreign pointer implementation. 
-- -DSLOW_FOREIGN_PTR

-- TODO, there's a bug with the include-dirs setting. if you install the
-- package from another directory, it won't be able to find the
-- (relative) path to cbits. Not sure how to work around this.
