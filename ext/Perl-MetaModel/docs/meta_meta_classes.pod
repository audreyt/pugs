=head1 Meta-Meta-Classes

... or How to twist your brain up in knots without even trying.

=head1 Introduction

This document is an attempt to clarify (and hopefully simplify) the all too hairy
topic of MetaClasses. I wrote this document to help me with my own understanding 
of this topic. I make no guarentees that this will make sense to anyone else or 
that the information contained within is I<correct> or I<one and only way> to view 
the concept of MetaClasses.

That said, I will first attempt to define the environment in which our objects 
exist. I will then define the entities which populate said environment.

=head1 The Object Environment

Let us assume for a moment that all our object's live in an I<object> environment 
(B<O>), which is a finite set of objects, each of which is identified with a 
unique object reference.

Here is a diagram of the entire object environment, and each of it's subsets:

    +---{instance}-----------------------------------------------------------+
    |                                                                        |
    |              +---{class}---------------------------------------------+ |
    |              |                                                       | |
    |              |              +---{meta}-----------------------------+ | |
    |              |              |                                      | | |
    |              |              |                +----{meta-meta}----+ | | |
    |              |              |                |                   | | | |
    |   ------     |    -----     |    -------     |    -----------    | | | |
    |  ( iFoo )------->( Foo )------->( Class )------->( MetaClass )   | | | | 
    |   ------     |    -----     |    -------     |    -----------    | | | |
    |              |              |                +-------------------+ | | |
    |              |              +--------------------------------------+ | |
    |              +-------------------------------------------------------+ |

=head2 Rules of the object environment

Our object environment has a set of rules which help to define the elements that 
exist within it. 

=over 4

=item B<Every I<instance> is an object.>

These are the occupants of our environment B<O>. It should also be noted that 
every I<instance> has a uniquely associated entity called a I<class>.

=item B<Every I<class> is itself an I<object> whose instances are (obviously) I<instances>.>

This means that the I<class> space (B<C>) is a subset of B<O>.

=item B<Every I<meta-class> is an I<object> whose instances are I<classes>.>

This means that the I<meta> space (B<M>) is a subset of B<C> which is a subset of B<O>.

=item B<Every I<meta-meta-class> is an I<object> whose instances are I<meta-classes>.>

This means that the I<meta-meta> space (B<MM>) is a subset of B<M> which is a subset 
of B<C>, which is a subset of B<O>.

=head2 Querying the Object environment

Since everything is simply a set or a subset of a set, we can use simple set difference 
operations to query the contents of our overall object environment.

=over 4

=item to get all ordinary object do (C<B<O> - B<C>>)

=item to get all ordinary classes do (C<B<C> - B<M>>)

=item to get all ordinart meta-classes do (C<B<M> - B<MM>>)

=back

=head1 So what is a Meta-Meta-Class anyway?

Lets first define the other objects in our environment.

=head2 So what is an Object?

An C<Object> is a primitve in our model and can be viewed as a simple data dictionary.

Here is an example of how an object describing a book might look like:

  {
      Book => { 
        'title'  => "VALIS"
        'author' => "Phillip K. Dick"
      }
  }

=head2 So what is an Instance?

An I<Instance> is simply an object with a I<class> key in the data dictionary whose 
value is the class reference from which the instance is derived, and a set of instance 
variables (which are defined by the class (and which we will see later)).

So a C<iBook> instance of the class I<Book> would look like this:

    {
        'class' => Book
        Book => { 
            'title'  => "VALIS"
            'author' => "Phillip K. Dick"
        }
    }

=head2 So what is a Class?

A I<Class> is itself just another data dictionary, however it's structure is a bit 
more complex. 

First, our class must have a name.

A class also needs to have a set of default instance variables from which new 
instances can be created. 

Next, our class needs to have a method table, which is just another data dictionary 
whose keys are labels and whose values are code references. This table is seperate 
from the instance variables becuase methods remain in the class, and are not 
copied into the instance.

And lastly, we have inheritance. Our class needs to have parents, which we represent
as an ordered list of other I<Class> objects.

So given that, our I<Book> class might be structured something like this:

    {
        'class' => Class,
        Class => {
            'name' => 'Book'
            'parents' => [ ... ],
            'instance_vars' => {
                Book => { title => '', author => '' }
            },
            'method_table' => {
                'get_author' => sub { ... },
                'set_author' => sub { ... },                    
                'get_title'  => sub { ... },
                'set_title'  => sub { ... },                                        
            }
        }
    }

As you can see, our I<Book> class is itself an instance of the meta-class I<Class>. 

A list of supported instance variables and methods can be found by accumulating a properly 
sorted unique list of all a class's instance_vars and method_tables merged with those of 
it's ancestors. These lists make it is possible to determine the instance variable and 
method resolution order. 

=head2 So what is a MetaClass?

Once again, we can represent our meta-class as a data dictionary. Here is an example of 
how the meta-class I<Class> would look:

    {
        'class' => MetaClass,
        MetaClass => {
            'name' => 'Class',
            'parents' => [ ... ],
            'instance_vars' => {
                Class => { 
                    'name'          => "",
                    'parents'       => [],
                    'instance_vars' => {},
                    'method_table'  => {}    
                }
            },
            'method_table' => {
                'create_instance' => sub { 
                    return { 'class' => Class, Class.<instance_vars> }
                }
            }
        }
    }

The C<instance_vars> for a I<Class> are basically those of an empty parent-less class, 
nothing more, nothing less. The simplicity of this notion can be somewhat difficult to
swallow. The tempation is to make it seem much more complex, but in reality it is not.

We also take this opportunity to define a C<create_instance> method for our I<MetaClass> 
which basically just creates a new data dictionary, adding the required 'class' key and 
value pair, along with a copy of the C<instance_vars>. Again, it need not be any more 
complex than that.

=head2 So what is a MetaMetaClass?

Now we are back to our original question, and hopefully by now the answer is quite obvious.

A MetaMetaClass is simply a concrete implementation of the data structures we have been 
constructing above. Our MetaMetaClass is the root of our object hierarchy, and the object from
which all others can be defined.

"That's all?" you say. "But it can't possibly be all!". 

It is of course important to keep a few things in mind, the first of which is that this 
MetaMetaClass is actually independent of a given programming language. That it is not 
something which the "user" should ever really have access too. It is a part of the compiler 
and/or runtime environment upon which a programming language resides.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Much of what is found in this document is a direct rip-off of the contents of the first
few chapter of this book (defined here as an instance of a Book class):

    {
        'class' => Book,
        Book => {
            'title'     => "Putting Metaclasses to Work",
            'authors'   => [ 'Ira R. Forman', 'Scott H. Danforth' ],
            'publisher' => 'Addison-Wesley'
            'isbn'      => 0-201-43305-2,
        }
    }

However, despite my plagarism/summariazation, I still take responsibility for all errors, 
inconsistencies or outright lies this document might contain.
