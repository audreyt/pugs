The first Perl 6 bounty challenge!

Not only Google is providing monetary support to Perl 6 development. Enthusiast
Conrad Schneiker offers 1_000 US Dollars to the first person to come up with a
wiki written in Perl 6. If all parties are willing to cooperate, @Larry will
specify the requirements, The Perl Foundation will escrow, and feather will
host.

It'll be interesting to see this fly.
