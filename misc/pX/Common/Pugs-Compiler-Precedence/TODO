TODO file for Pugs-Compiler-Precedence

- Pugs::Grammar::Precedence and Pugs-Compiler-Precedence/ should have the same name

- add Makefile.PL, MANIFEST

- needs to use category identifiers, like INFIX
  maybe INFIX_004 for category+precedence?

- \s{ is an expression terminator if the parser is expecting an operator

- add is-parsed to the appropriate category in op-precedence and tokenizer

- PCP needs to return a Match object?
  (maybe a match-like object is more appropriate?)

- The P::Yapp 'expect' state can be verified inside
    %{$self->{STATES}[$self->{STACK}[-1][0]]{ACTIONS}}
