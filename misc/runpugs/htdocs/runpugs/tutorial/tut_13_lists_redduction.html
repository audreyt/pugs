Reduction Operators
To form the reduction operator,
surround any infix operator by […]
# Add all elements of the array
my $sum = [+] @values;
# Multiply together numbers from 1 to $n
my $factorial_n = [*] 1..$n;
# Check if the list is sorted ascending
if [<=] @list {
say "Sorted ascending";
}
