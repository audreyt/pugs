* maybe add context to search results?
* links to colabti irclogs - but how to know for which channels?

Already done:
* import of colabti irclogs
* full text search

15:29 < [particle]> if you're in the mood for adding more, processing 
                    S05:546-549 would be grand. as well as S05/"Nothing is 
                    illegal"
15:30 < [particle]> oh, i should say, *highlighting* the text and processing 
                    S05:546-549
