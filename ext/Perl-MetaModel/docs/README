=head1 Perl6 Meta-Model Working Documents

This set of documents is an ongoing attempt to create a meta-model 
for Perl 6. Each document serves it's own specific purpose and should
(to some degree) be read in order. What follows is that order:

=item F<meta_meta_classes.pod>

This document attemtps to clarify (and hopefully simplify) the all 
too hairy topic of MetaClasses. This may not be the I<correct> or 
I<one and only way> to view the concept of MetaClasses; many books 
have been written on the subject which all use subtly different 
concepts and terminology.

This document uses a very bottom-up approach to illustrate a 
meta-meta-class system, which may or may not be how we approach the 
perl6 meta-model.

The sole purpose of this document is to explain the idea of 
MetaClasses as simply as possible to that the 

=item F<create_your_own_object_model.pod>

This document attempts to build on the concepts found in the 
F<meta_meta_classes.pod> document and illustrate how one might use
that information. 

Again, this is just for the purposes of explaining meta-models and 
may or may not be how the Perl6 meta-model is constructed.

=item F<perl6_meta_model.pod>

This document hopes to provide the working basis for the Perl 6
Meta-Model; in a sense, it builds on the brief notes at the end of
Synopsis 12 (see L<S12>) that describe introspection, and carries it
to its logical conclusion.

This document is purposfully denser than the previous documents. 
Nuff said.
