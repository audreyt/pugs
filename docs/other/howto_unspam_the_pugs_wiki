The pugs wiki is frequently spammed, its home page replaced by a large
number of links.  Here is how to undo the damage.

(1) Has the wiki been spammed?

Most spamming occurs on the home page,
  http://pugs.kwiki.org/
also known as
  http://pugs.kwiki.org/?HomePage

You can check
  http://pugs.kwiki.org/?action=recent_changes
to see if other pages have changed.

If fetching the home page (or recent changes) hangs, it is usually
because the home page has been replaced by a LARGE spam.  Try some
other page to see if the server is still up.  Eg,
  http://pugs.kwiki.org/?PugsDownload
  http://pugs.kwiki.org/?PugsCommunity

(2) How to fix the home page...

Start with revision -1, and work backwards until you find a page which
both responds, and seems to have unmangled content.

  http://pugs.kwiki.org/?action=revisions&page_name=HomePage&revision_id=-1

Click on Edit, and then the Save button.

And that's it.  Fixed.
Thanks for you help in keeping the wiki clean.

Variations in spam style suggest multiple attackers, rather than
repeated attacks, perhaps because we have been so quick to clean up.
