- added HACKING file

-- this cuts memory needs by half while compiling Test.pm
- use v5; ... use v6;
-- inlines perl 5 code
- named enums
- bool::True, bool::False, true()
- unless, while
- setting $ENV{V6DUMPAST} can now be used for debugging the syntax tree

- added REQUIREMENTS section in v6.pm pod
-- see http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=20152

-- very basic support for 'has', 'method', and parameter list
-- Makefile.PL recommends 'Moose' 

- properly parses pod
-- added t/01-pod.t 

- more operators
-- added a default '.perl' implementation, which calls perl5 Dumper()
