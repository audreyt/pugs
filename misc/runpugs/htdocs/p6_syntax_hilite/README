INSTALLATION
    Simply this directory index.html to your apache htdocs,
    and you'll be able Perl6 syntax highlight on the browser (client-side).
    
    To re-use simply use index.html as a template (jquery is not needed).

NOTES
    This script is useful in blogs, tutorials, ..etc
    Not recommended for 100+ lines scripts as Javascript RegExp is slow
    Syntax will be improved along with upcoming misc/runpugs runscript enhancements
