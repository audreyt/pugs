feel free to add here ideas for the YAPC::Europe hackathon - pmurias

* from kp6 roadmap: 
  - Hash, Array
  - types -> signatures, captures -> multis
  - Improve the roadmap

results:
- Junction impl and tests
- Multi implemented in Perl 6, needs more detailing

* running the nqp (Parrot's mini-Perl6) test suite

* initial javascript backend

* remove KindaPerl6/Runtime/Perl5/DispatchSugar.pm

* "tree transformation language" - ruoso

results:
- dakkar - XSLT-like transforms written in perl5

* PIR emitter??

results:
- we can improve the existing mp6 emitter to bootstrap mp6,
  and then we will be able to compile kp6 to parrot.
- kp6 can parse a modified TGE syntax, it needs a runtime

* Is "module Main" implied?
