        subject: RAII in Perl6/Parrot
        summary: |-
          Previously on this thread,
          Blair Sutton asked if Perl 6 would be able to do RAII. He cited some articles
          which expressed the view that it was not possible in Python due to the fact
          that garbage collection does not offer deterministic finalization. This led to
          the question of whether Perl 6 would suffer from the same problem due to
          Parrot's style of garbage collection.
          
          Larry Wall replied that deterministic reference counting was only one way to
          provide transactional security and timely destruction. He assured Blair that
          Perl 6 has ways to let you not care about some dependencies, while paying
          attention to others.
          
          Blair appreciated Larry's explanation, and admitted to relying on the
          deterministic nature of C++, and using RAII to manage locks between threads
          and tear apart sockets cleanly. He asked for an example of Perl 6 offering the
          capability to execute code once every reference to an object has been removed.
          Luke Palmer replied that the LEAVE closure trait was a general method for
          addressing this.
          
          This week, Blair posted a script in Perl 5 with a multi-threaded RAII idiom.
          Blair asked if the LEAVE closure trait takes the previous role of P5's DESTROY
          or if it will always be executed when one falls out of scope.

        subject: Numeric Semantics
        summary: |-
          Last week,
          the subthread was further expanded, with TSa suggesting that all rounding
          functions such as floor, round and trunc take an optional second argument
          which defines the jump size. TSa also proposed a number of division function
          pairs, such as fdiv and fmod for flooring division and modulus, or tdiv and
          tmod for truncating division and modulus. Smylers felt that this would
          introduce far too many functions in to the Perl core, given that few people
          would use them. Smylers felt that it was more appropriate to have them as
          modules. Jonathan Lang added that it was unlikely anyone would need multiple
          definitions of division and modulus at any given time, so modules made sense.
          The only question he saw was which definition was default, the mathematically
          elegant one or the industry standard one.
          
          The main thread was revived when TSa replied to Luke Palmer's
          question of whether 1 is different from 1.0. TSa wanted 1 to be an Int and 1.0
          to be a Num. There was some discussion with Jonathan Lang over the
          relationship between Int and Num, specifically which one does the other.
          
          This week, Larry Wall put his foot down and stated that the default `/` operator
          is not going to do integer division and that this is not negotiable. Later in
          the thread, Larry said that for various practical reasons, he didn't think
          that Int can be treated as a subset of Num. He agreed that `1.0 == 1 !===
          1.0`.
          
          Larry's messages generated praise from Smylers, but TSa was not satisfied.
          However, he did not receive a noteworthy response this week.

        summary: |-
          This commit message by Larry Wall logged the following: "Tweak `|` to provide
          longest-token instead of short-circuit semantics. Now use `||` for old
          short-circuit semantics!" In a follow-up message, Larry elaborated: 
          
          This checking majorly changes the semantics of `|` within regex to support
          required longest-token matching semantics rather than left-to-right matching.
          It will enable us to write parsers more consistently, and it also opens up
          normal regexes to better optimization via tries and such. You can now use `||`
          for the old `|` semantics, which is majorly consistent with how `|` and `||`
          work outside of regexen.
          
          Patrick Michaud asked if a similar situation would arise for `&` versus `&&`.
          Larry answered that, for reasons of consistency, that would indeed be the
          case.

        subject: The S13 "is commutative" trait
        summary: |-
          After reading that binary operators may be declared as commutative, Dave Whipp
          asked if this is restricted to only binary operators, or if he could tag any
          function/method with the trait. After a brief discussion, Larry replied that
          he had decided "is commutative" must die of ill-definedness.  See instead
          the recent S13 change to support multiple signatures on a single body.

          This commit, by Larry Wall, changes how regular expressions are analyzed.
          They are seen as pattern/action pairs and grammars as collections of those
          pairs.  In addition 'token' is defined more rigorously.

        subject: 'Remember: Outlaw to declare a lexical twice in the same scope'
        summary: |-
          Steve Lukas reminded people of a proposal from September which involved
          a change on S04 and linked to an earlier edition of this summary to
          describe the conclusions which had been reached.  He requested that
          the changes be made.  Carl Mäsak
          added that he also considered this to be an important issue.
          He wanted to see a warning when a lexical is declared
          twice in the same scope.
          
          Dave Mitchell and Smylers clarified how it works in Perl 5 (it's
          possible, but generates a warning).

        subject: Smooth or Chunky?
        summary: |-
          Larry Wall asked for some advice with a missing generalization that
          he hadn't been able to work out yet.  Given that `zip`
          and `each` produce similar results, he wondered what is the use
          of two functions which do almost the same thing.  This led him to
          believe that zip should return something different and let the
          context determine whether the result should be flattened.  This
          led to musings on a default smooth and an optional chunky, and a
          question on whether chunky should be the default when it makes more
          sense.  He suggested various options.
          
          Darren Duncan thought that the Perl 5 approach of default 'smooth'
          with optional 'chunking' was appropriate.  As an example he offered
          the smooth `map { $_, $_ * 10 }, 1..3` versus `map {[$_, $_ * 10]}, 1..3`.
          Larry replied that this was one function where the approach was possible,
          but that Perl 5 has many places where it fails to scale well to a
          multi-programmer team.
          
          Ruud H.G. van Tol believed that it looked like a 'multiple faces'
          domain.  He sees the dimensionally structured data as a living
          entity which should give different representations depending upon
          the requirements.  As an example, he cited a meal, a recipe and
          a shopping list, adding that his preference was for the shopping
          list to be ordered by where things are found in the store.
          Brad Bowman suggested that the dimensional information should be
          retained, but that it might not need to be returned.
          
          Ben Morrow proposed `[[]]` as a nice visual way to indicate that
          a list should be built.  Blair Sutton listed several possible syntax
          options.  Austin Frank joined in, offering the outverse of `[;]`,
          namely `];[`.

          As of February 6th, the test was still failing on Darwin.

          Earlier,
          Jerry Gay complained that the perlcritic coding standards test was using
          resources, and asked in ticket <rt://perl/41230> if someone
          could look in to this problem.  Paul Cochrane reported that he thought
          there was a memory issue relating to `critique()` and that the memory
          was only freed up when the tests for a given policy are complete.  Paul
          elaborated on what what he had attempted to address the issue.
          
          This week Jerry Gay congratulated Jeffrey Thalhammer on version 1.01 of
          Perl::Critic, which solved the memory issue.

        subject: More embedding questions
        summary: |-
          Isaac Freeman explained that he needs an embedding interface which
          allows more control over the interpreter and cited some examples of
          control he required.  He asked specifically about the ability to
          inspect and modify namespaces.  chromatic pointed him to PDD 21,
          which is not completely implemented.

          was never actually specced, but that he did consider it like a NULL pointer
          in C.  He felt it was debatable whether the use Matt demonstrated should
          be allowed.

          Paul Cochrane asked which version of Parrot James was using, as the files
          involved should be marked as exempt because they are automatically generated.
          In r16702 the tests pass even without the patch.

        summary: |-
          Will Coleda announced that he had two issues with the new Tcl implementation: 
          speed and the implementation of `trace`.   After noting that there is a
          way to set traces for Parrot subroutines, he requested the ability to
          declare hooks to call pre- and post sub invocations.  Ideally these could
          be declared at compile time.  He offered to write more complete specifications
          if the idea was interesting to others.
          
          Allison Randal offered a few comments and requested the detailed
          proposal.  Jerry Gay advised looking at Perl 5's Hook::LexWrap.
          Klaas-Jan Stol offered a suggestion which would leave the original
          subroutine untouched.

        summary: |-
          James Keenan noted, in ticket <rt://perl/41329>, that coding standards
          tests break some tests in `t/tools/pmc2cutils`.  He believed that it
          happened in r16751, when code was changed to conform with the standards
          but wasn't run against the tests and submitted a patch to correct
          the problem.  Paul Cochrane explained that he had run the tests, but
          that he hadn't done enough, and apologized.

          In ticket <rt://perl/41331>, Will Coleda referenced an earlier
          thread (<msgid:rt-3.6.HEAD-1774-1170522221-888.41329-14-0@perl.org>)
          which mentioned that some tests failed as a result of coding standards
          being applied.  Several Tcl tests were failing.  They were fixed by
          r16774.

        summary: |-
          Leopold Toetsch noted that some changes not too long before the
          release had broken `pg.t`.  He found the problem in the object
          constructor, and mentioned that he'd made several attempts to unify
          object construction but that it wasn't very successful.
          
          Matt Diephouse explained that he had made the change with Allison
          Randal's approval, to eliminate differences between PMCs and
          objects.  Leopold replied that he thought the differences were
          confusing but that they still were.  He linked to his
          [proposal for method calling](http://groups.google.at/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/e68dc0a0a96585b7/076502809495f8e2?lnk=st&q=parrot+instantiate+toetsch&rnum=5#076502809495f8e2).

        subject: Parrot 0.4.8 Released
        summary: |-
          Jerry Gay announced the release of Parrot 0.4.8, "Eponymous".
          
          Jarkko Hietaniemi questioned whether there was in fact extended support
          for Tru64, as he had only reported problems for subsystems like PGE.
          chromatic offered Jarkko commit access, but Jarkko declined.
          
          Matt Diephouse volunteered to work on Tru64 if someone could give him
          access to a system.  Nicholas Clark replied that HP gave access to a
          number of test systems, but not Tru64.  Jarkko grumbled about HP's
          restriction.  Unfortunately he was not able to provide a developer with
          Tru64 access.  He thought that perhaps development on any 64-bit
          platform would already improve Parrot.
