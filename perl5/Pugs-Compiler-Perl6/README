NAME
    v6-pugs - an experimental Perl 6 implementation (under way)

SYNOPSIS
    Command line:

        $ perl -Ilib lib/v6.pm -e ' for 1,2,3 -> $x { say $x }'

    Compile-only:

        $ perl -Ilib lib/v6.pm --compile-only -e ' <hello>.say; '

    Script or module:

        # file: hello_world.pl
        use v6-pugs;
        "hello, world".say;

        $ perl hello_world.pl

DESCRIPTION
    The "v6" module is a front-end to the experimental Perl6-to-Perl5
    compiler.

    The current state of this compiler implementation only provide a small
    sample of Perl 6 syntax and semantics.

  Other Perl 6 implementations
    The Pugs/Haskell Perl 6 is currently the most complete implementation.
    Pugs currently has some issues with Perl 5 interoperability.

    Parrot Perl 6 is the best performing implementation by far. The Parrot
    implementation is currently at a comparable state as v6.pm.

    Although running "v6" requires the installation of a lot of Perl 5
    modules, it is completely independent of Pugs or Parrot.
