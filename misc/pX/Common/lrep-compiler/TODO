OUTSTANDING PROBLEMS

The grammar, the way it is today, causes very-deep-repetitive-loops
we should refactor the grammar in a way to avoid such loops.

THE REAL MISSION IS TO SELF-HOST LREP

Already in Perl 6:
./lrep.p6
./Grammar/Perl6.p6
./Grammar/Perl6Primitives.p6

Still in Perl 5:
Rule Closures in ./Grammar/Perl6.p6 are just filtered, not compiled
./Runtime/Perl5/RuleOps.pm
./Runtime/Perl5/RuleInit.pm
./Grammar/Perl6Init.pm
./Emitter/Perl5.pm

TECHNICAL DEBT

* Refactor rules to represent better the reality (see Grammar_Model.txt)
* Use P::C::R as runtime, as this code is older than that...
