TODO list for KindaPerl6

The kp6 Milestones are:

- finish kp6-spec
- lexical subs 
- metamodel interface
  - bootstrap == kp6-2
- lexical classes
- begin blocks
- containers

Visitor modules:

- add variable declarations collector
  - move variable declarations to the start of each block

- LexicalSub.pm
  - add 'our' subs to the namespace, if there is one
  - verify the interface with native p5 subs, such as 'Main::say'
  - only create a "lexical sub" call if the sub is in scope

- MetaClass.pm
  - add class variables
  - test bootstrap
  - roles
  - alias Class::MOP's 'meta' to 'HOW'
    ---
    package Class::MOP::Class;
    sub meta { Class::MOP::Class->initialize(blessed($_[0]) || $_[0]) }  
    ---
    
Other:

- star/GLOBAL namespace 
    zzz()
    --> ($_SUB_zzz || $GLOBAL::_SUB_zzz)->(@args)
    $*foo
    --> $GLOBAL::foo
    but:
    TimToady> under strict there is no fallback to global unless you explicitly import (you also get a snapshot of GLOBAL imported automatically at the start of compilation)
- OUTER namespace

For later:

- desugar blocks into real subroutines, in support for the parrot backend

- desugar closures into simple subroutines, in support for the C backend

- temp/state desugaring, for perl5

- 6-on-6 design
  - full-ast
