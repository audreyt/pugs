mp6/kp6 FAQ

15:04:22 < fglock> I'm looking for a starting point for kp6 docs
15:08:10 < ZiggyE> you could start by documenting the way kp6 should be run and how to regenerate lib5
08:39 < avar> explain what subset of p6 it covers


* Where is fglock?

fglock will be in Capao da Canoa beach for a whole month.  offline.
when? XXX - from jan. 25 


* Overview - What is mp6/kp6/v6?

v6 is a perl6-on-perl6 project.
It lives in the Pugs repository, under the v6/ directory.

This is not the perl5 v6-alpha, see perl5/Pugs-Compiler-Perl6 for that.

There are 4 subprojects under v6/:

v6.pm is a plain translation of the perl5 v6.pm compiler, such that the modules could be interchangeable.
This project is currently abandoned.

v6-Compiler (full-p6) is meant as a more advanced compiler, but it is also more difficult to bootstrap because it needs a more complete Perl 6 compiler.

v6-MiniPerl6 (mp6) is a subset of Perl 6 used to bootstrap the full Perl 6.
v6-MiniPerl6 is bootstrapped with perl5.

v6-KindaPerl6 (kp6) is a reimplementation of mp6, with a very flexible compiler workflow.
kp6 uses plugins in order to implement perl6 semantics over several backends.
kp6 is not currently bootstrapped - it is compiled with the mp6 compiler.

The current plan is to bootstrap full-p6 using kp6.


* How can i help?

  <fglock> the current work under way is the implementation of the compile-time environment
    which is needed for fixing lexsubs, and for BEGIN blocks 	12:15
  <Ziggy6> KindaPerl6::Visitor::LexicalSub? 	12:17
  <fglock> yes - the plan is to start by implementing a Closure class, with some introspection capabilities
    K::V::LS needs to be split: create the env, and then do the lexsubs 	12:19
  <Ziggy6> why is introspection needed? can't we just use Perl5 closures? 	12:19
  <fglock> we need access to the lexical variables, and it would be nice if it can return it's source code if needed
    brb
    I didn't add the env prototype to the repo - one sec
    Ziggy6: the tricky part is that compile-time closures are both program and data 	12:28
  <svnbot6> r15119 | fglock++ | kp6 - added docs/begin-block.pl - p5 prototype for 'env' implementation 	12:28
  <Ziggy6> i don't understand, can you point me to the relevant part of the synopsis? 	12:30
  <fglock> Ziggy6: see the discussions in kp6 docs/begin-block.pod 	12:31
  <Ziggy6> compile-time closure = closure contained in a BEGIN block? 	12:32
  <fglock> pretty much all closures need to exist at compile-time; and some of them survive until run-time


* What subset of Perl 6 is covered by mp6?
  (from miniperl6-spec.pod)

    - A program is organized in compilation units. All statements must be inside a 'class' declaration:
        class X { ... }
    - All statements finish with semicolon
    - Only allow one feed of positional arguments
    - In Signature, disallow "is slurpy", "is optional", "is named"
        (*@bad) ($bad?) (:$bad)
    - But we do allow Hash and Array and Tree unpacking:
        sub foo ([$a, $b, $c], {:$x, :$y}, ::Tree $top (:$left, :$right)) { ... }

        foo([1, 2, 3], { x => 1, y => 2 }, ::Tree( left => 1, right => 2 ));

        # This compiles to:
        sub foo {
            my perl6::Tree $top;
            my ($a, $b, $c, $top, $x, $y, $left, $right);
            ($a, $b, $c)  = @_[0];
            ($x, $y)      = @_[1]{'x', 'y'};
            $top          = @_[2];
            ($left, $right) = ($top.left, $top.right);
            ...
        }
        foo([1, 2, 3], { x => 1, y => 2 });

    - As a consequence, object constructor calls must be written in
      coercion form:
        ::Foo( x => 1, y => 2 );   # NOT Foo.new

    - Only allow item context
    - No laziness; all List are Seq
    - No subtyping (inheritance) or role mixins
    - No first-class Capture and Signature objects, which means no \$x nor :(foo)
    - No assignment, only bindings, but don't panic:
        $x := $x + 1;   # name = IntOp(named(Int))
        # $x = $x + 1
      The reason is we have to eliminate one of them to avoid dealing with:
        $x := $y;
        $x = 123;
      Because assignment always involve box(unbox()), so emitting binding to
      Perl 5 is much more straightforward as $x is always just a Int in
      ($x := $x + 1), never SomePossiblyTiedScalarContainerType that needs to
      have special FETCH magic associated with it.

      Also it's inevitable with eliminating list context, because:
        ($x, $y, $z) := (1, 2); # compile-time error
        ($x, $y, $z) = (1, 2);  # list-context-undef-fill that we don't want to deal with
      because infix:<=> almost always imply slurpiness with LHS is not a simple scalar,
      eliminating it is consistent with eliminating list context.

    - Allow Type annotations. Preserve them Perl 5 emitted code using simple Typed vars:
        # MiniPerl6
        my Int $x;
        my perl5:CGI $x;

        # Compiled Perl 5
        my perl6::Int $x;
        my CGI $x;
      However, the compiler adds no extra assertions so types never slows programs down
      in MiniPerl6 land.

    - Closures, but no coroutines nor continuations
    - Closed grammatical categories and precedence levels
    - No macros; no BEGIN blocks!
    - No multis

* can mp6 be run in perl5?

yes, and it's currently the only fully working implementation

* can mp6 be run in pugs?

nobody tried ???

* can mp6 be run in parrot?

There is an implementation of a parrot emitter, but it cannot run full-mp6 yet.

The implementation of the PAST emitter is also under way.

* can mp6 be run in ruby/javascript/c#/c/d ?

There is some work done for a D implementation.

Ruby and Javascript can probably reuse some work that was done for redsix and pil2js.


* Running mp6

There are control scripts for compiling mp6 to several backends:

Perl 5:

  perl mp6-perl5-boot.pl < source.pl > dest.pl
  
Parrot:

  perl mp6-parrot.pl < source.pl > dest.pir

Parrot-PAST:

  perl mp6-past.pl < source.pl > dest.past


- Bootstrapping mp6-perl5:

This script rebuilds the lib5 directory. It creates a directory named lib5-new:

  perl util/build-perl5.sh
  mv lib5 lib5-old
  mv lib5-new lib5


- What subset of Perl 6 is covered by kp6?

kp6 reuses the mp6 grammar.
The main differences are not visible - kp6 adds an extra AST processing step.


- Running kp6

kp6 works by creating a parse tree, which is then submitted to a list of AST processors.

The 'kp6-perl5.pl' script is one of the possible compiler 'workflows' that can be built with kp6.

  perl kp6-perl5.pl < source.pm > dest.pm


kp6 currently depends on the mp6 perl 5 runtime.
The mp6 lib5/ directory needs to be included in order to run kp6 programs:

  echo ' class X { say 42; }  ' | perl kp6-perl5.pl | perl -Ilib5 -I ../v6-MiniPerl6/lib5
  ---
  42

- Compiling kp6

As of this writing, kp6 is not bootstrapped.

The kp6 source files can be compiled with mp6. There is a 'mp6.pl' script in kp6 directory:

  perl mp6.pl < lib/KindaPerl6/Visitor/EmitPerl5.pm > lib5/KindaPerl6/Visitor/EmitPerl5.pm
  

* How much of the test suite passes?

No tests pass at all.

With mp6, it was possible to pass t/01-sanity/01-tap.t by preprocess
removal of "use v6-alpha;" and wrapping the input in "class Main {...}".
Something similar might be done for kp6.  See pugs/project_planning/TALK.

kp6 currently lacks assignment to variables, so even
t/01-sanity/02-counter.t fails.


* How much of the test suite will eventually pass?

? XXX

The code generated by the parser makes several method calls on each
character - this can be optimized with inlining (not planned for mp6).
A MiniPerl6::Perl5::Match is created for every character.

* Re parser:

The parser is recursive-descent.

* Why isn't kp6 self-hosting? 

kp6 is still under implementation - the lexical-subs tranform is
currently breaking p5 compatibility, this is being fixed.
that is, it can't call the p5 runtime
-- <fglock> 2007-01-22

update - the lexsubs step was removed from the kp6-perl5.pl, until this is fixed. 2007-01-23

* Why isn't there a makefile to regenerate v6-KindaPerl6/lib5/ ?

the workflow for compiling kp6 is not fixed - you can add or take AST transformation steps
kp6-1 will have a script

* What is the plan for kp6?


- provide a minimal bootstrapped language implementation for bootstrapping p6-on-p6

    Extra features over mp6 - allow the implementation of BEGIN blocks, flexible grammar.

- implement a flexible/pluggable compiler engine

    This is currently done with a Visitor pattern for AST transforms

- lexical subs 

    Allows operator redefinition:
    
    my multi infix:<+> { ... }

    But note that 'multi' is not part of the kp6 spec

- lexical classes / first-class classes

    Better support for grammar mutability

    $?GRAMMAR   Which grammar am I in? (from S02)
    @?GRAMMAR   Which nested grammars am I in?
        
- metamodel interface

    Allow pluggable object models

- begin blocks

    This is needed to support separate compilation - that is, separate compile-time from run-time 

- containers

    This is needed to implement assignment - MP6 only supported binding.


* Is kp6 needed for bootstrapping 6-on-6?

No. 6-on-6 can also be bootstrapped with:

- parrot

- pugs

- v6.pm

- plain mp6

- redsix

* Miscellaneous Notes

fglock: hmm - maybe for mp6; need to find a way to do eval() too - http://cataclysm.cx/2006/08/19/closures-in-c/
