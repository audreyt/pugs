* BROADCAST TASK - Check ./STATUS and see if systems with which you
  are familiar are correctly described.  Skills: be familiar with some
  system. ;)

* The "runpugs" idea still needs pickup: Basically, write (or find) a  
generic, line-buffered web/terminal bridge that hooks something like IPC::Run
with a web-based terminal display, with, for example, HTML::FromANSI for
display, so we can have a Pugs shell online for people to play with.

* Look at directories under t/; move or merge the incoming tests  
under xx-uncategorized/ to the directory to which they belong. In addition 
to that, try to reorganize the increasingly overlapping and incoherent 
directory-naming scheme a bit, perhaps grouped by synopses names (see 
doc/Perl6/Spec/) and then by section names as subdirectories.

* We already have "evalbot" under examples/network/; if Pugs build  
fails, currently it simply uses the last-known-good version of ./pugs binary.
However, it would be great for the bot to report a build failure (perhaps
with nopasted log) on the channel.

* Spellcheck and POD format docs/Perl6/Overview/*.pod.

* Rearrange t/ so that it is suited for reuse with multiple Perl 6
implementations.  The generic Perl 6 tests, suitable to all Perl 6
implementations, go in t/, and if any tests seem to be implementation
specific, then perhaps this indicates the standard needs updating.

* Remove all unconditional SKIP/TODO flags from t/, either replacing them
with conditionals that only SKIP if the current Perl 6 implementation's
CONFIG vars explicitly don't support the features that the test is for, or
just letting them fail.

Another choice is to define implentation-specific (and also version-specific)
TODO options like :pugs<6.28.0> in Test.pm's is/ok/dies_ok/etc functions.
For example:

    is($got, $expected, :pugs<6.28.0>, :p6p5<0.100>);

This TODO test will expire automatically when Pugs is at or over version
6.28.0. The same is true for the Perl 5 implemenation (expire at v6-alpha 0.100).

gaal proposed to introduce a &todo function to Test.pm which will TODO the
next test:

    todo(:pugs<6.28.0>, :parrot<0.112>);
    is($got, $expected);

which is a nice variant.

* Re-group the majority general/implementation-generic Perl 6 tests first
along lines of what is likely to be implemented together and/or by tier, a
trivial example already in place being the sanity tests.  With the sanity
tests plus Test.pm being tier zero, each additional tier can incorporate
progressively more "difficult" features, and not assume that anything in
tiers above it will work, only that those in tiers below it do.  This
progression can be similar to how various other technical standards (such
as XML or SQL) can come in tiers, with minimum mandatory plus optional
additional features.

* Gather ideas for our t/ testing and validation suite.
t/ is getting to be a maintenance headache.  It's not going to scale
another 2x, 3x, 4x, whatever.  Look at new modern languages (eg,
scala, slate, pypy), at big languages (ghc, mono), and elsewhere (where?).
Bring us ideas.  Skills: as described.

* Scan docs directory for files which say "I am out of date" and list
  them below.  Skills: none.

* Reoccuring task: Syncronize docs/ with current language spec.
Skills: understand p6 well enough to read p6l and Synopses.
You can check your understanding of changes on #perl6.
Things specifically known to need updating:
 * docs/quickref/namespace

* Reoccuring task: Check the [date] timestamps in STATUS.  They show
the last time that section was verified as still correct.  If one is
old, check with someone to see if it has changed.  What someone?  Ask
on #perl6.  Skills: polite nagging.

* ./pugs -V doesn't mention / is sloppy about a lot of stuff:
  Note also  say %?CONFIG.perl;
  Skills: p5, build system.
** Notably, whether parrot and or p6 have been embedded. It should.
   May be hard? - the build system is a bit messy.
** It should perhaps also answer the "usual questions for someone with
   a problem" - what os, cpu (64 bit?), ghc version, gcc version.
** Some of the data lifted from `perl -V` at build time is bogus; for
   example, `archname` on my system is i486-linux-gnu-thread-multi
   because that's where debian's perl came from.

* Add function aliases in misc/S29_round.pl. Will increase Google juice.
Skill: know how to make a p6 function alias
FIXME native english: 'toward' or 'towards'? the article uses both...
    round_half_up_symmetric => round_matlab
    round_half_up_asymmetric => round_java
    round_half_even => round_bankers
    round_half_even => round_vb
    round_random => round_stochastic
    round_ceiling => round_towards_positive_infinity
    round_floor => round_towards_negative_infinity
    round_toward_zero => round_fix

* Setup CruiseControl and have it report build failure to the #channel.
Skill: light sysadminship, code a logfile to IRC gateway (reuse a bot?)
