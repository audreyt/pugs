# to enable URL rewriting for nice URLs, you have to adapt the following two
# lines, and you have to change the URL emitting code in index.pl and out.pl.
# The URLs will look like this: /irclog/channel/ for today, and
# /irclog/channel/2007-04-20 for a specific day
#RewriteBase /irclog/
#RewriteRule ^(\w)/?$			out.pl?channel=$1
#RewriteRule ^([^/]+)/(\d{4}-\d\d-\d\d)$ out.pl?channel=$1;date=$2
