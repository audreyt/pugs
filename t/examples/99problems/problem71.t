# P71 (*) Determine the internal path length of a tree
# 
# We define the internal path length of a multiway tree as the total sum of the
# path lengths from the root to all nodes of the tree. By this definition, the
# tree in the figure of problem P70 has an internal path length of 9. Write a
# predicate ipl(Tree,IPL) for the flow pattern (+,-).
