L<Synopses|http://dev.perl.org/perl6/doc/synopsis.html>.

The Pugs project was started on February 1st 2005.  It is under active

Please read the Pugs Apocrypha in the F<docs/> directory for more details.

=head1 DOCUMENTATION

=head2 Pugs Apocrypha

The Pugs Apocrypha in the F<docs/> directory are a series of documents, written
in question/answer format, to explain the design and implementation of Pugs.

=head2 Quick reference of Perl 6

Quick reference documents of Perl 6 can be found in the F<docs/quickref/>
directory, similar to L<perlcheat>. The table of contents can be found at
F<docs/quickref/README>.

=head2 Talks

There're various talks about Perl 6 and/or Pugs in F<docs/talks/>. Look into
F<docs/talks/README> for links to rendered versions (HTML, PDF).

=head2 Examples

In the F<examples/> directory there're examples of working Perl 6 code. In
F<examples/cookbook/> you can find the Perl 6 version of the Perl 5 cookbook.
If you want to see how Perl 6 modules look like, you can have a look at the
modules in F<ext/>. Another good source of working Perl 6 code is the
comprehensive test suite in the F<t/> directory.

=head2 Apocalypses, Exegeses, and Synopses (AES)

Additionally to the L<official AES|http://dev.perl.org/perl6/>, Pugs hosts a
number of unofficial AES at F<docs/AES/>. You might also want to checkout the
Perl 6 module L<Perl6::Bible>, hosted at L<FreePAN|http://www.freepan.org/>
(L<http://tpe.freepan.org/repos/iblech/Perl6-Bible/>), if you want to read the
AES by using the C<p6bible> command line utility.
