Parse::Yapp - Parse::Yapp  Yet Another Perl Parser compiler

Compiles yacc-like LALR grammars to generate Perl OO parser modules.

IMPORTANT NOTES

The Parse::Yapp pod section is the main documentation and it assumes
you already have a good knowledge of yacc. If not, I suggest the GNU
Bison manual which is a very good tutorial to LALR parsing and yacc
grammar syntax.

The yapp frontend has its own documentation using either 'perldoc yapp'
or (on systems with man pages) 'man yapp'.

Any help on improving those documentations is very welcome.

DESCRIPTION

This is production release 1.05 of the Parse::Yapp parser generator.

It lets you create Perl OO fully reentrant LALR(1) parser modules
(see the Yapp.pm pod pages for more details) and has been designed to
be functionally as close as possible to yacc, but using the full power
of Perl and opened for enhancements.

REQUIREMENTS

Requires perl5.004 or better :)

It is written only in Perl, with standard distribution modules, so you
don't need any compiler nor special modules.

INSTALLATION

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

WARRANTY

This software comes with absolutly NO WARRANTY of any kind. 
I just hope it can be useful.
