This is a list of services that should "just work", and who maintains them.
If you provide a service related to pugs, perl6 or #perl6, please add
yourself to the list.

autosmoke on feather                    agentzh
irc logs                                moritz, <moritz at faui2k3 dot org>

p6eval                                  moritz
pugs_svn                                moritz
rakudo_svn                              moritz
speckbot                                moritz

both Auzon and pmurias have access the server on which p6eval and the svn bots
run, so if something went wrong and moritz_ isn't available, you can prod
them instead.
