doing just fine without the dollar sharp
proof of the momentum of the Perl 6 project
a really neat gismo
stealing all the good ideas it can from those other languages
providing the capability to evolve a little faster
well-timed
officially Turing Complete
alive
not going to bite
happening now
an implementation of Perl 6
a love letter to the Cabal
a "Good Morning" to a sleepy programmers' community
known to clean up nicely in the shower
a coffee-cup thrown against the wall
programming with Class
Perl 6 raised to the power of woot!
cashing in the tuits
a real Perl
sensitive (to semantic, pragmatic, and cultural context)
to perl 6 as gestation is to birth
a marvel
a "Hello Perl!" from Haskell
test driven
"Perl6, now!"
a good thing
already fun
growing fast
pretty near useful
going great shakes
committed to change
proof of the concept of a perly functional language
strict by default
a hyperoperator applied to the collective Perl imagination
a grab-bag of new ways to shoot yourself in the foot
