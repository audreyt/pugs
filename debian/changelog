pugs (6.2.10-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Renamed 30includedirs.dpatch to 30cabal.dpatch and added some more changes
    that should make installing libghc6-pugs-dev finally work.
  * Removed libghc6-plugins-dev build-dep. It isn't in sid yet anyway.

pugs (6.2.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Build-Depend on libyaml-perl, libtest-tap-model-perl,
    libtest-tap-htmlmatrix-perl, libcompress-bzip2-perl. They are needed for
    smoking.
  * Use smoke-pugs instead of a simple Harness test.
  * Removed environment hook for not sending smoke results from debian/rules.
    PUGS_BUILD_OPTS can handle that now.
  * Suggest perl and spidermonkey-bin needed by -BJS and -BPerl5.
