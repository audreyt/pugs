NOTES Pugs and GHC-6.8.1

- I needed to do 'sudo runhaskell Setup install' for HsSyck, hsregex and Pugs
-- This is because the build process needs to use the '--user' flag to pull in stuff from the local user package database and not exclusively the system database,
- The most important changes are in the .cabal files due to the refactoring of the base package.
- The new ByteString API also required some changes
- Most issues were with scoping of "wobbly types", so the fixes are almost all added type annotations
- I had an issue with the Readline library, but that is probably OS X specific. I added
  "-L/usr/local/lib","-lreadline" to the GHC build command (in Makefile.PL) to fix it.
- {-# INCLUDE -} now seems to require an absolute path, at least I had make
  the path to dist/build/Pugs/Embed/Parrot_hsc.h in
  dist/build/Pugs/Embed/Parrot.hs absolute (that is, the first line needs to
  look like '{-# INCLUDE
  "/home/gwern/bin/pugs/dist/build/Pugs/Embed/Parrot_hsc.h" #-}').
