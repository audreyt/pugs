TASKS for the Pugs Test Suite

* Substitute '$*EXECUTABLE_NAME' for all occurrences of './pugs' and 'pugs' in the tests after pugs supports it. (finished)
* Implement smart comments for TODO/SKIP tests
* Update t/closure_traits/*.t to conform with the latest S04.
* Implement the TODO smart comments proposed by Jerry Gay in the test harness:
    # todo :pugs<feature>
    # todo :parrot<bug>
  The syntax used here is certainly negotiable.
  See http://svn.perl.org/parrot/trunk/t/compilers/pge/perl6regex/rx_captures for examples in PGE's test suite.
