As pugspc is far from complete, the full TODO would be very long.

However, following features are high on the agenda:
* Add the ~~ operator in the PIR Prelude (prelude.pir), so we have regexes.
* Currently, only "my" lexicals are supported correctly. Supporting our, has,
local, state requires relatively small changes to the Haskell code but mainly
requires figuring out the correct PIR code to implement them.
* Currently, lexicals are looked up without namespace, i.e. assuming the
current package namespace. Making the lookups qualified should not be very
hard.
* The Perl 6 Prelude (compiled to p6prelude.pir using the script
compile_prelude.pl) needs to be extended. This means writing Perl 6 code, so
should be easy.

Next in line:
* Object support
* Modifying function arguments, e.g. in chop(), is broken.
* Implementing file IO, sockets etc
