Tree::Simple for perl6/Pugs version 0.0.1
========================

This is the start of porting several OO CPAN modules. I plan on 
using this port to help generate a number of OO tests for pugs 
in the near future. 

STATUS

Currently the status of this port is:

- Tree::Simple code has mostly been ported to perl6, but none of
  the documentation has been.
- Tree::Simple::Visitor has not been ported at all
- the tests have not been ported yet either (a number of them can
  actually be eliminated, specifically the leak and weaken tests)
