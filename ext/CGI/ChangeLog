* change 'cookies' attribute spelling to 'cookie', to stay consistent
with Perl5. (We could add "cookies" as an alias if you feel strongly...).  (Mark Stosberg)

with them. They should now be be basically working. (Mark Stosberg)

(Mark Stosberg)
* Implement code/docs/test for Dump function from p5:CGI (Mark Stosberg)
* Use 'type' rather than 'content_type', for compatibility with p5:CGI 
(Mark Stosberg)
* Only send the Content-Type header if we have a content-type (Mark Stosberg)
* Only send "Status: " header if it's a redirect, or it's explicitly added.
