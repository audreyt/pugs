NOTES

This directory is intended to become a backend boostrap.  Ie, code
written in p6, which, with the assistance of an external (rakudo)
parser, can compile itself.

elf_zero is a throw-away version written in ruby (normal ruby, not 1.9).
elf_one is written in p6, and is intended to become the bootstrapped version.

./elf_zero_generate.pl -e 'say(3)'

The creation of elf_one was perhaps premature.  After all, elf_zero
doesn't yet even have command-line options to compile or execute p6
files.  But it servers to illustrate the eventual intent.  And might
perhaps become a source of "we need feature X to work in elf_zero, so
we can implement Y in elf_one" guidance for the elf_zero minimum
feature set.
