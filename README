INSTALLATION
------------

Pugs needs the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) 6.2 or above.  To install GHC,
download a binary build from http://haskell.org/ghc/.  Although source code
for GHC is available, it will take a very long time to build by yourself. 

To install Pugs on your system, simply type this in the command line:

    cpansign -v         # optional; see SIGNATURE for details
    perl Makefile.PL
    make                # or 'nmake' on Win32
    make test
    make install
