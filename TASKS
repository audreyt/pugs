* BROADCAST TASK - Check ./STATUS and see if systems with which you
  are familiar are correctly described.  Skills: be famaliar with some
  system. ;)

* Add a note to lib/pugs/hack.pod mentioning that under
http://rt.openfoundry.org/Foundry/Project/Source/index.html/pugs/browse/
the "(history of this directory)" lists the revisions which affected
the directory you are currently looking at (all the subdirs to of course).
Skills: understand this paragraph. can say it more clearly.

* Gather ideas for our t/ testing and validation suite.
t/ is getting to be a maintenance headache.  It's not going to scale
another 2x, 3x, 4x, whatever.  Look at new modern languages (eg,
scala, slate, pypy), at big languages (ghc, mono), and elsewhere (where?).
Bring us ideas.  Skills: as described.

* Scan docs directory for files which say "I am out of date" and list
  them below.  Skills: none.

* Reoccuring task: Syncronize docs/ with current language spec.
Skills: understand p6 well enough to read p6l and Synopses.
You can check your understanding of changes on #perl6.
Things specifically known to need updating:
 * docs/quickref/namespace

* Reoccuring task: Check the [date] timestamps in STATUS.  They show
the last time that section was verified as still correct.  If one is
old, check with someone to see if it has changed.  What someone?  Ask
on #perl6.  Skills: polite nagging.

* When building with external parrot, Makefile.PL says parrot must be
in PATH, but doesn't check.  It would be nice if it checked.  You can
check if parrot is there with can_run('parrot').  Skills: basic perl5.

* Remove the "embedding parrot is NOT recommended on" lines from
Makefile.PL and INSTALL.  They were just there for the 6.2.11 release.
Skills: none.

* docs/notes contains context_coercion.pod (audreyt's) and
context_coersion.pod [sic] (luqui's).  Name (one of?) them something
more reasonable.  Skills: taste.
