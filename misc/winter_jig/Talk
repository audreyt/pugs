== What is this? ==

This is a Talk page, a discussion page.

Just like a Talk page on Wikipedia.  Well, rather more difficult to
access, seeing as it's in svn.  And feel free to not run vandalbots
and link-spam adding bots against it.

But a place where you can easily add stuff, without worrying about
trying to "fit it in" to some existing text.

== Syntax (and an excuse to add a second section) ==

Just add a "== Whatever ==" section, and you're good to go.

The Wikipedia comment convention of

is a nice one. :)
