The Perl 6 Language
Iterating Over An Array
Iteration = doing something for each
thing in the array
The bit between the curly braces is
done for each thing in the array
-> $name means “declare $name and
put the current thing into it”
for @fave_foods -> $food {
say "Jonathan likes to eat $food";
}
