This directory contains the POD files from which the blog entries at
http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-5-to-6/ were generated.

Feel free to use them for your own purposes, under the same terms as perl or
pugs itself (you may choose).

These files are not automatically synced with the blog, so if you want to push
some changes to the blog, you have to contact moritz_ on #perl6 (or see the
AUTHORS file in pugs root dir for the email address).
