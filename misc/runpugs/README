2006/10/10      Release of version 0.1.0 of runpugs/WebTerminal
==============================================================================


NAME
    runpugs: a web teminal for interactive pugs 
    WebTerminal: library for building a web terminal for interactive shells

INSTALLATION
    * To install, copy all folders to your web root
    (e.g. ~/apache on feather, or /var/www elsewhere)
    Rename html folder if required (e.g. htdocs -> html or public_html)
    * To run, simply point your browser at it. To avoid a wait, you might start
    * the terminal server script (bin/termserv.pl) manually. If you don't, the cgi script will take care of it, but it takes a bit longer.

DESCRIPTION
    runpugs has two main components: 
    -a cgi script (cgi-bin/runpugs) which uses an html template
    (data/runpugs.html). The latter calls the runpugs.cc stylesheet from
    htdocs/runpugs.css
    -a server which handles the interactive pugs sessions and communicates with
    the cgi script. The pugs sessions stay alive for some time (currently 30') if
    left inactive.

   The underlying library, WebTerminal, can in principle be used for any
   interactive shell, not just pugs. But I'll have to do some refactoring and
   cleaning-up first. Then we can have Python :-)
   See the (currently non-exisiting) POD for more info.
