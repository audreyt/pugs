* Ideas

6-on-6 on parrot
- through onion (perl6 on parrot)

6-on-6 on pugs
- simple syntax fixes (mp6)

mp6 regex engine
- implement DFA

mp6
- merge back the AST processor from kp6
- improve the regex compiler architecture with OO nodes, AST processor

PCR
- implement DFA
- OO nodes, AST processor

* Startup list

- make an "almost pass-thru" emitter for mp6->pugs, bootstrap with it

- make some experiments with "onion", see what works

- regex parser - create ast nodes; change the grammar to emit these nodes
