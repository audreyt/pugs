TODO for Pugs::Grammar::Rule and Pugs::Emitter::Rule::Perl5

- remove 'grammar1' namespace everywhere
- 'Pugs::Grammar::Rule::Lib' - old p5 code... -- 'use' in P:G:R

- rule switches

- missing rule syntax (see README)

- namespace problems:
  - rules are compiled in the Pugs::Grammar::Rule namespace
  - user-defined rules are local to the current package
    and will need to be called with full-name (until fixed)

- write the Match class

- write more tests (port from lrep)

- rewrite the compiler (port from lrep) ???
  (it works without a compiler)

- remove (now empty) Pugs::Emit::Rule.pm

- add in Pugs::Grammar::Rule:
  - 'use Pugs::Grammar::Rule::Engine'
  (for now, just add it in the main program)
  
- optimization: precompile the rules that have return blocks:
   my $rule = sub { ... }
   *xxx = sub { $rule; ... }

- optimization: inline code in the Engine
