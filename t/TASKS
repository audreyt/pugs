TASKS for the Perl 6 Test Suite

Add any requested tests or other updates to this file. Please organize them by synopsis (when applicable) or put them in the OVERALL section at the top if they apply to the test suite in general.

Please also read t/deprecated-syntax.pod for common mistakes in the test
suite, and clear them when you update tests.

When you are adding entries here, please put something like this in the commit message:
Test Suite TASKS: Added to section S02
This way, people working on the test suite can easily spot these commits in #perl6.

This file had entries in the past (r16405). Since this file wasn't touched in over 4000 commits, I (Auzon) cleared them out.

OVERALL
* Add smartlinks to tests without them
* Continue moving tests from t/ to t/spec/
* Clean up old POD
* Fudge tests for Rakudo where helpful
* Improve the Vim syntax highlighting to recognize test keywords
* Review XXX entries for test corrections

S03
* tests for cmp() and eqv() methods of objects
* test that '@array, *' repeats the final element infinitely
* tests for other range edgecases

S12
* tests for $object.WALK
* tests for $object.*@candidates
* tests for "but" (such as 0 but Bool::True)
* tests for metamethods (under "Introspection" in S12)
* tests for autovivification
* more tests for inheritance. Auzon noticed that there were no multiple inheritance tests, so other important things are bound to be missing.

S16
* Is there a reason that S16-io/say.t doesn't use plan()?
* tests for glob()

S29
* tests for array: shape and end
* tests for complex: polar
* tests for pack and unpack
* tests to ensure that rand has a bit of entropy
* test for $number.rand (method form)

IO
* more tests for say() and print(). For example elf prints array references
  as ARRAY(0x8832e28). This might be a bit tricky because we either have to
  capture stdout, or open a pipe to a second script.
