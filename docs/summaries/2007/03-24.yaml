          Thom Boyer responded to Damian Conway's post from November which
          thanked people for offering feedback on the first draft.  Thom said
          that he had been unable to find the XHTML version of S26 and wondered
          if it was available.
          
          Jerry Gay replied that there wasn't a pod parser available yet.
          Damian responded with the requested file, and said he still hoped
          to finish the Pod6 parser but he wasn't sure when he would have time.
          
          Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason
          asked if Damian could post the code he currently has, so that others
          could work on it.

          with `make test`.  Later he reported that he had heard that this test was

          expected failures need to be marked as TODO, because volunteer time is
          being wasted.  Jonathan Worthington agreed.

          Jerry Gay noted in ticket <rt://perl/41878> that Allison Randal had
          replaced the `.IMPORT` macro with the `export_to` namespace which
          was defined in PDD21.  However, the code was lacking safety checks
          and he suggested creating an Exporter PMC.  
          
          Allison elaborated by
          suggesting an interface.  Patrick R. Michaud added his comments.
          A discussion on importing followed, with Will Coleda also contributing.

          He thought a `make cover` target could be added to the Makefile.
          
          Paul Johnson mentioned the option of using  Devel::Cover to generate
          the reports.  Paul Cochrane also noted that there was a script in

          Steven Pritchard remarked that he had been working on getting a package
          built for Fedora, and shared his current package.  Allison Randal
          asked if he had kept track of the things which caused problems, so
          that the packaging process could be improved.
          
          chromatic speculated that installation paths which are not present
          or are incorrect is a common problem.  Allison agreed, and wondered if
          some tests could be created to check for installation paths.  Mike
          Mattle explained some of the difficulties in doing this.
          Joshua Isom thought that it would not too difficult.
          
          Steven made a list of his three major problems: hardcoded 'lib',
          `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` had to be set to `blib/lib` in the top directory,
          and the `languages/` files aren't autmatically installed.

          Jesse Vincent announced the Perl 6 Microgrants program.  Leon Brocard,
          representing the Perl Foundation's grants committee, will work with
          Jesse to select proposals for projects.  Grants are for 500 USD.  Proposals
          should be for projects which can be completed in 4-6 calendar weeks.
          
          Tim Bunce suggested that someone could create a tool which could parse
          that Java files which define the JDBC API and generate Perl 6.   He did
          not want to submit the proposal himself, but hoped someone would take it
          up.  There were a few comments on this suggestion.  Phil Crow had some
          interest in the idea.
