Todo:
 - Perl6-Value and Perl6-Container need work.
   Especially hashes.
 - PIL node handling is still very incomplete.  See EvalX.
 - Things have gotten rather crufty. Cleaning is needed.

Plan:
 - Support/encourage development of Perl6-Value and Perl6-Container.
 - Switch over to MetaModel2.0 when it's ready.


Smoke notes:

make smoke-perl5 is currently buggy.
Some tests non-terminate or exhaust memory.
To run make smoke-perl5 on linux, 
 $ ulimit -v 750000   # 750 MB.  Or whatever. May not be needed anymore.
 $ export PUGS_HACK_TIMEOUT=1000
 $ rm t/builtins/control_flow/die.t t/operators/repeat.t t/statements/next.t t/subroutines/recurse.t t/builtins/arrays_and_hashes/kv.t
 $ make smoke-perl5 > log 2>&1
But first, run
 $ ./pugs -B perl5 -e 'say "ok"'
just to make sure your PATH is configured.
Takes about 2 hours at 1GHz.
