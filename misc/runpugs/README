DESCRIPTION
    runpugs has two main components: 
    -a mod_perl script (/perl/runpugs.pl) which uses an html template
    (/data/runpugs_async.html). The latter calls the runpugs.css stylesheet from
    /htdocs/runpugs.css. The script is called from /htdocs/runpugs/index.html
    -a server (/bin/termserv.pl) which handles the interactive pugs sessions and communicates with
    the mod_perl script. The pugs sessions stay alive for some time (currently 10') if
    left inactive.

    This version has some AJAX goodness and runs under mod_perl.
    The entrypoint is /htdocs/runpugs/index.html, which calls /perl/runpugs.pl

   The underlying library, Web/Terminal, can in principle be used for any
   interactive shell, not just pugs. So we could have runpython :-)
   See the POD for more info.
