The idea is take some regexp override, like re::override::pcre, and
run it against the perl5 re test suite.  Hook and engine failures
can't be distinguished, but there is really no other way to test the
hook than to use it.  And creating a stub engine which uses the real
perl5 regexp engine creates too many opportunities for the hook only
working because of some out of band interaction between the engine and
the rest of the perl core.

Filter-based regexp overrides don't work with the tests as currently
organized.  Fixes welcome.

This is a "rough cut" set of test files.  Some may be unnecessary.
Some useful ones may be absent.

Anything which tests regexps should be here.  Because the regexp
struct is largely an "open api", which many parts of perl understand
and fiddle with, one can't extrapolate from "regexp hook works with X"
to "regexp hook works with Y".  We need to test both.

We should set things up so developers can run the entire perl5 test suite.

Usage:

  PERL5OPT=-MSomeModule make test

The tests are run in package main (with only one or two exceptions).
So if, for example, you wish to test a regexp override, then SomeModule
should set that up for main.
