README for Set Perl 6 extension
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sets are a basic language construct.  They are in the core Perl
language as junctions, but to many the syntax is confusing.

This module presents Sets as objects, using an interface similar to
the Set::Object and Set::Scalar CPAN modules.

Some people might detest the use of a top level namespace for this
module, but I think a Set is a top level thing.  No doubt this is why
they are in core as junctions.

This module will try to provide both a Role and an implementation for
Sets, once I figure out the syntax :-)
