<h1>FAQ: Can I use CGI/mod_perl on feather?</h1>
<p>
Yes, but not via the default Apache. Every form of web development requires
specific settings, and that makes maintenance hard. It is, however, very easy
to run your own Apache. Here's how:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
cp -rp ~juerd/apache ~
perl -i -pe's/juerd/$ENV{USER}/g' ~/apache/httpd.conf
perl -i -pe's/Listen 8000/"Listen " . (7000 + $&lt;)/e' ~/apache/httpd.conf
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
To start your web server, run <tt>/usr/sbin/apache -f ~/apache/httpd.conf</tt>.
To stop it, run <tt>killall apache</tt> (ignore that it couldn't kill the
system wide apaches).
</p>

<h1>FAQ: How do I redirect my feather email to my other mail address?</h1>
<p>
Use qmail's .qmail system. See <tt>man dot-qmail</tt> for details.
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
echo '&amp;other-address@example.org' &gt; ~/.qmail
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h1>FAQ: How can I upload files to feather?</h1>
<p>
If you are on Windows, you should get the <I>psftp</I> program first. <I>psftp</I> is usually
bundled with Putty.

To use the proxy settings of Putty in <I>psftp</I>, simply save the Putty session as
something like "feather", and then enter the following command:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
  C:\> psftp username@feather
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
psftp has an interface similar to the <I>ftp</I> utility provided by Windows itself.
</p>

<h1>FAQ: Can I keep a script running on feather?</h1>
<p>Surely you can, as long as you use the ``sleep'' command or something like that.</p>

<p>
If you're trying to instruct feather to do certain things periodically, please consider
using the <I>cron</I> program. Here's a tutorial on cron:
</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.unixgeeks.org/security/newbie/unix/cron-1.html">
http://www.unixgeeks.org/security/newbie/unix/cron-1.html
</a>

<p>
Use of the ``crontab -e'' command on feather is strongly recommended.
</p>

<p>
If you are looking for automatic refreshing of the pugs source tree, you can
always read ~audreyt/pugs/, which is constantly being updated from svn via evalbot
according to Audrey.
</p>

<h1>FAQ: How can I override the default charset of feather's Apache?</h1>
<p>
Simply create a .htaccess file under your ~/public_html/ with the following line in it:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
  AddCharset your_encoding .html
</pre>
</blockquote>

Usually ``your_encoding'' is set to UTF-8. After that, Apache will use the
encoding you've specified in .htaccess for all the .html files in the current
directory I<and> all its subdirectories.

Apache loads .htaccess on every request, so there should be no delay once
you have set this.

This web site is in Pugs' repository, in docs/feather. If you have the time and skills to improve it, please do not hesitate. In style, structure and contents, it's awful at this moment :) The site is synced every 5 minutes.
