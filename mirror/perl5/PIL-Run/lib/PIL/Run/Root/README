There are no files or directories here under PIL::Run::Root.
PIL::Run::Root is the playpen of perl5-runtime for perl6.
It uses and abuses the p5 symbol table system to do its work.
But in its own private way.  Nothing here is usefully accessed
directly from p5.  You have to go through the runtime.

Perl5 code for the runtime goes in PIL-Run/lib/PIL/Run/...
Perl6 code for the runtime goes in PIL-Run/lib6/...
