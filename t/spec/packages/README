t/spec/packages/README

This directory exists to hold files tested in S10-packages so that there isn't
a hyphen in the filename of the .pm file. This way, we can just
    use t::spec::packages::Whatever;
instead of needing to quote the package name all the time, or add the proper
directory to the Perl 6 equivalent of @INC.
