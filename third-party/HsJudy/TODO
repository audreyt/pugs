# NOW
- Filling in Judy/Private.hsc with low-level FFI bindings, try to be in sync
  with spinclad's third-party/judy.
- Make sanity checks to see if it's all working right.
- Cabalize HsJudy. 


# NEXT
- Discuss APIs

- Document this work.
- Create a LICENSE file (I think BSD3) and put license info in the
  necessary files.
- Check for Language Shootout entries that could benefit from HsJudy,
  and take Shootout times for them.
- Remember to test RBR with HsJudy. =)
