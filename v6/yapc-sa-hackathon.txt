* Ideas

6-on-6 on parrot
- through perl6 on parrot

6-on-6 on pugs
- simple syntax fixes (mp6)

mp6 regex engine
- implement DFA

mp6
- merge back the AST processor from kp6
- improve the regex compiler architecture with OO nodes, AST processor

PCR
- implement DFA
- OO nodes, AST processor

* Startup list

- make an "almost pass-thru" emitter for mp6->pugs
  - bootstrap with it
  - can we reuse the native '$/' ? 
  - consider redefining mp6 to run natively on pugs

- make some experiments with perl6-in-parrot, see what works
  - alternately, try out tcl-in-parrot

- regex parser 
  - create ast nodes; 
  - change the grammar and emitters to use these nodes
  - implement '|', possibly reusing <%hash>

- merge kp6 back into v6.pm/PCR
  - implement the kp6 ast-processor into v6.pm
