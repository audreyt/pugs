Bootstrapping MiniPerl6 in Perl5

- reduce the amount of RAM needed to recompile MP6

- Recompile it several times using itself, in order to check the stability of the Bootstrap

- Freeze the project, because it can be useful to bootstrap other VMs

Missing Backends

- Javascript, Haskell, Parrot

- MO in MP6 (MP6-2)

Missing Features

- type annotations

- autoquotes hash keys

- double quote interpolation and "\n"

- operator precedence

- all statements need a semicolon

- 'use v5' is not supported
  (maybe not needed for MP6)

- no 'state', 'constant'

Missing Features of the Token sub-compiler

- no quantifiers

- no variable interpolation

Bugs

- Hash binding implementation is wrong

- 'for' loops always need to specify '@{}', as in:  for ( @$a ) {...}
  even if the variable has a '@' sigil

- binding ':=' and param binding should share implementations
