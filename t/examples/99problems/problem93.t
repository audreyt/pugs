# P93 (***) An arithmetic puzzle
# 
# Given a list of integer numbers, find a correct way of inserting arithmetic
# signs (operators) such that the result is a correct equation. Example: With
# the list of numbers [2,3,5,7,11] we can form the equations 2-3+5+7 = 11 or 2 =
# (3*5+7)/11 (and ten others!).
