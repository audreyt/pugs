Rosetta - Rigorous Database Portability
---------------------------------------

The direct parent folder of this README file is home to the
2005.09.29-initiated re-birth of the various modules that comprise and/or
were created to be used by or used with the Rosetta database access
framework.  There are 2 versions of this Rosetta framework that are being
developed concurrently, which are coded natively in Perl 6 and Perl 5
respectively, and which will frequently maintain parity with each other;
both versions have a copy of this same README file.

All of these modules are Copyright (c) 2002-2006, Darren R. Duncan
(perl@DarrenDuncan.net, "http://www.DarrenDuncan.net/").  All rights
reserved.  See the individual modules themselves for their licensing terms;
most of them are GPL v2+ with an exception.

The Perl 6 version is currently included with Audrey Tang's Pugs project,
and lives in its "/ext/Rosetta-Incubator" sub-directory during the short
term, and its components may later be split up into other "/ext"
sub-directories; Pugs' homepage is at "http://pugscode.org/", and it has an
open Subversion repository at "http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/".

The Perl 5 version has an open Subversion repository at
"http://svn.utsl.gen.nz/trunk/Rosetta-Incubator/", and it its components
are regularly packaged for CPAN under "http://search.cpan.org/~duncand/".

The Perl 6 version is the "main" one which is expected to have a longer
life, and its design is optimized around best practices that are natural in
Perl 6.  At the same time, however, the Perl 6 language is new and a moving
target, and current hosts or run-times for Perl 6 code are only partially
complete, so this version may be slower to become functional in the first
place.  This said, the Rosetta framework is being developed in Perl 6 now
so it can serve as an integration test for Pugs, helping its development.
Moreover, it should assist other early-adopter developers that want to
write database using applications in Perl 6.

The Perl 5 version is designed to approximate the Perl 6 version as much as
is possible under Perl 5, and it employs various third-party extensions to
Perl 5 which assist in that effort, such as "version", "List::MoreUtils",
and "Class::Std", but no non-trivial source filters.  At the same time, it
should still be efficient by Perl 5 standards and be very useful to Perl 5
programs.  Certainly it will be stable and useable in production
environments a lot earlier, due to the fact that Perl 5 isn't a moving
target.

These are the anticipated core components of the Rosetta framework:

* Locale::KeyedText
* Rosetta::Model
* Rosetta (and Rosetta::Validator)
* Rosetta::Engine::Native
* Rosetta::Utility::SQLBuilder
* Rosetta::Utility::SQLParser
* Rosetta::Engine::Generic
* Rosetta::Emulator::DBI

For reference, the older pre-rebirth Perl 5 version has an open Subversion
repository at "http://svn.utsl.gen.nz/trunk/Rosetta-old/" (holding the last
2 months of its development, and it has been released on CPAN under
"http://search.cpan.org/~duncand/" in the form of 165 distribution releases
dated between 2003.01.05 and 2005.09.28, all of which are on BACKPAN and on
the author's web site.  An older pre-rebirth Perl 6 version of just the
Locale::KeyedText component was included with Pugs between its 6.0.11
(2005.03.14) and 6.2.10 (2005.10.10) releases, inclusive.

Feedback on and assistence with this framework is greatly appreciated.

This project has no email or IRC channels dedicated to it, but the author
is frequently on #perl6 at irc.freenode.net and #tangram at irc.perl.org,
as well as various email lists for Perl database related projects.
