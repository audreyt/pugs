As far as it seems, the only thing missing to bootstrap kp6 is to port
the following files from mp6 calling convention to kp6 calling
convention, besides writing a "v6-alpha" like interpreter and writing a
compiler.

lib-kp6-kp6/KindaPerl6/Runtime/Perl5/Compiler.pm
  * Almost done, missing begin-block side effects. But we can do that after
    the bootstrap. I'm keeping the P5 version by now, which is not in use to
    keep the code.

lib-kp6-kp6/KindaPerl6/Runtime/Perl5/Pad.pm
  * This is a very important one.

lib-kp6-kp6/KindaPerl6/Runtime/Perl5/MP6Runtime.pm
lib-kp6-kp6/KindaPerl6/Runtime/Perl5/Grammar.pm
