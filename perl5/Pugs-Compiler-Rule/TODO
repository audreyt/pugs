TODO for Pugs::Compiler::Rule (PCR)

Before merging pX (2006-08-01) 

- BUG: %hash should pass 'pos' to subrules

- Makefile.PL should clean the regex cache

- run Pugs-Compiler-Perl6 make test

- use base 'RegexBase' in the docs; or change Grammar::Base name

- add 'negate' node to Regex
- add tests for 'negate'

After merging pX (2006-08-01) 

- document new Match methods: data, str, perl, capture, state

- finish 'static' capture count

- finish remaining metasyntax in <!...> Grammar

- static signature for '$^a' 

- add 'inlined' switch to disable PadWalker lookups

- fix the <ws> rule

Unicode:

- \v \h \V \H

Sigspace switch:

- 'doubled' <ws> doesn't work
  my $rule = Pugs::Compiler::Rule->compile('a (b) * c' );
  - but this works:  
  my $rule = Pugs::Compiler::Rule->compile('a (b )*c' );
- implement, test in non-ratchet rules

Ratchet switch:

- more tests
  - interoperability with non-ratchet
  - non-ratchet subrules need to know current "$pos"
- quantifiers
  - implement ?? +? *?
  - implement ?+ ++ *+
  - implement captures to Array inside quantifiers
- is :ratchet allowed as a runtime switch?
  - are there runtime switches?
  - is :+ the non-ratchet specifier?

Perl 6 parser:

- implement Perl 6 minilanguages (and categories).
  each language generate entries for the tokenizer hash
  <%statement_control|%prefix|%term>
- implement the main tokenizer using the minilanguages as terms

Priorities:

- implement <%hash> using trie

- features used in PGE P6 Grammar
- <after ...> in non-ratchet
- char classes

- make PadWalker optional, as most distros don't hold PW 1.0

- move files to /perl5; fix paths in Makefile.PL

- Match: .from and .to not implemented in subrules

- '%var := xxx'; '@var := xxx'; %<var> := ; @<var> :=

- rule parameters 

- :P5 rules

- add placeholder 'not implemented' messages in the right places

- make Emitter::Rule::Perl5 subclassable - such that closures can be 
  parsed/compiled by a custom parser
- make the 'return' block functionally detectable (instead of regex)

Bugs:

- $variable should look into the user pad

- in Pugs::Emitter::Rule::Perl5.pm
 * <[^a]> should be [\^a]
 * fix <[!)]>

- ratchet rules can't call non-ratchet rules

Categories (some things belong to P::C::Perl6) :

- see "Syntactic categories" in S05 (extensibility)

- finish documenting add_op( %options )

- return AST

- memoize/recompile dynamically

- special cases (test):
  <tight> <op>+ [<tight> <op>+]* <tight>?
  1;;;2  - ignore extra ;;?
  1,,2
  1, 2,
  1 Y 2 Y 
  loop ($a;;$b) { ... } - special form via macro?

Tests:

- unify ratchet/non-ratchet tests

- add categories looser/tighter than current boundaries

- backtracking control ':' 

- <'... <?... <!...

- more tests (port from lrep)
  
Related projects:

- implement (optional?) PCR in pugs
- implement PCR using pugs

- use PCR in lrep
  - merge the 'dual engine' in PCR (used by the lrep-compiled grammar)

- implement Pugs::Compiler::PILN ?
  - not a priority - p5 could load ready-made YAML from Pugs

Other:

- see 'not implemented' messages in Pugs::Emitter::Rule::Perl5

- migrate Pugs::Grammar::Rule::Rule compilation to PCR

- cleanup the non-ratchet engine: it is both returning the match, and building the match tree.
  There is no need to return the match.

- closures should be called on the Match object

- rule documentation (shorter than S05)
- examples of use

- incomplete rule syntax (see Pugs::Compiler::Rule pod); 
- more escaped chars

- More switches (:p, :ratchet, :sigspace are implemented)

- 'Pugs::Grammar::Rule' - old p5 code... -- 'use' in P:G:R

- optimization: inline code in the non-ratchet Engine; 
- "pre-generate" engine output?
- see "benchmark.pl"

- cached precompiled variable rules, per S05

- bug: can only access parameters through $^a $^b...
- bug: parameters must be constants

API:

- maybe change PCR->code() to PCR->as_method()


TODO for Pugs-Compiler-Precedence

- needs to use category identifiers, like INFIX
  maybe INFIX_004 for category+precedence?

- \s{ is an expression terminator if the parser is expecting an operator

- add is-parsed to the appropriate category in op-precedence and tokenizer

- PCP needs to return a Match object?
  (maybe a match-like object is more appropriate?)

- The P::Yapp 'expect' state can be verified inside
    %{$self->{STATES}[$self->{STACK}[-1][0]]{ACTIONS}}
