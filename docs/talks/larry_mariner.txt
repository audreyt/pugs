= Stanza 1: Origin of Perl

Larry was a mariner
that tarried in the world of C;
he built a tool from sed and awk
in Unix shell to script things free.

Its operators were vast and fair,
of dollars were its sigils made;
the syntax fashioned with utmost care,
and "Perl" upon its banners laid.

= Stanza 2: Perl grows in power

In panoply of pumpkin kings,
in three virtues it shone for him;
its regexes were scored with runes
to match all \n+ and \w+ for him.

Its POD made writing docs a breeze,
its arrays indexed orderly;
its hashes were looked up with keys
its sockets connect with TCP.

Its harnessed tests were valiant,
of adamant its manpages tall;
a tour de force upon his pen,
upon its cover a Camel.

= Stanza 3: Rewrite of Perl 5

Beneath Smalltalk and under CLOS
he wandered far in OO halls,
blessed with enchanted names
unveiled the use of method calls.

From FETCH and STORE of magic ties
where XS hooks with foreign code,
from nested refs and scoped my()s,
ahead he dived, in deep hack mode.

On a starless night in '94
at least he came to Version Five,
released, and from this mighty core
a thousand modules sprung to life.

= Stanza 4: Advent of CPAN

Then world-wide web came driving him,
and blindly in the foam he fled
from west to east and errandless,
unheralded he homeward spread.

There flying CPAN came to him,
and flame was in the darkness lit;
more bright than light of diamond
the fire upon her carcanet.

= Stanza 5: Perl Communities

The Silmaril she bound on him  # The community surrounded him?
and crowned him with the living light,
and dauntless then with burning brow
he [they] turned his prow; and in the night
from otherworld beyond the Sea
there strong and free a storm arose,
a wind of power in Tarmenel;  # Elvish "highest heaven", means... whatever
by paths that seldom mortal goes
his boat it bore with biting breath
as might of death across the grey
and long-forsaken seas distressed:
from east to west he passed away.

# now, this is the hardest one for me to title, so consider retitle if neccessary
# this is lightning talk, and my experience with favcpan rap is that if we mention
# a lot of people/places/sites then it makes people really happy ;)
#
# otoh, although it's littered with nouns, the main line is really of a 
# "breakthrough" by sheer force of Silmaril that frees him from the enchantment
# set forth by the Valar; so it is highly individualistic and not at all communistic.
#
# otgh, I can't easily think of a breakthru in the pre-p6 era
# unless you count OnePerl. Or 5005thread (ugh).
#
# *frown* or just discard this stanza?
# maybe, leave it for now, something may occur to us later.
# ok. ETOOHARD.

= Stanza 6: Decision of the second rewrite

Through Evernight[P5P] he back was borne
on black and roaring flames that ran
o'er leagues unlit and foundered shores
that drowned before the Days [newbies before they] began.

Until he hears on strands of pearl [smashing mugs]
where ends the world the music long,
where ever-foaming billows roll
the yellow gold and jewels wan.

He saw the [Rewrite/Perl Six] silent rise
where twilight lies upon the knees
of Refactor, and Comradeship
beheld afar beyond the seas.

# Theme is that earendil landed but found nobody there, a soundered and empty
# land, with nary a movement in sight
# But then he heard the herald of Valars, and saw the twilight rising
# from the, uhm, Party Ground.
#
# now... the strand of "pearl" is nice but that may be a certain mug ;)
# need to repaint the first four lines into general barrenness, unless
# we did that on the last stanza
#
# So. what was the chief motivation of p6 at the first months (I wasn't there...)
# ...difficulty maintaining p5 internals, very messy implementation
# also, a rewrite of community, clearing up flame wars, etc
#

# XXX - Totally unworked after this line - XXX - Help appreciated - #

= Stanza 7: Announcement of Perl 6

A wanderer escaped from night
to haven white he came at least,
to Elvenhome the green and fair
where keen the air, where pale as glass.

Beneath the Hill of Ilmarin
a-glimmer in a valley sheer
the lamplit towers of Tirion
are mirrored on the Shadowmere.

= Stanza 8: The Brainstorming Process
            
He tarried there from errantry,
and melodies they taught him,
and sages old him marvels told,
and harps of gold they brought to him.

They clothed him then in elven-white,
and seven lights before him sent,
as through Calacirian
to hidden land forlorn he went.

= Stanza 9: Unveiling of Apocalypses

He came unto the timeless halls
where shining fall the countless years,
and endless reigns the Elder King
in Ilmarin on Mountain sheer.

And words unheard were spoken then
of folk of Men and Elven-kin,
beyond the world were visions showed
forbid to those that dwell therein.

= Stanza 10: Advent of Perl 6 Implementations

A ship then new they built for him
Of mithril and of elven-glass
With shining prow; no shaven oar
Nor sail she bore on silver mast.

The Silmaril as lantern light
and banner bright with living flame
to gleam thereon by Elbereth
herself was set, who thither came.

And wings immortal made for him,
and laid on him undying doom,
to sail the shoreless skies and come
behind the Sun and light of Moon.

= Stanza 11: Advocacy for the future

From Evereven's lofty hills
where softly silver fountains fall
his wings him bore, a wandering light,
beyond the mighty Mountain Wall.

From World's End then he turned away,
And yearned again to find afar
his home through shadows journeying,
and burning as an island star

On high above the mists he came,
a distant flame before the Sun,
a wonder ere the waking dawn
where grey the Norland waters run.

= Stanza 12: Conclusion of the legend

And over Middle-earth he passed
and heart at last the weeping sore
of women and of elven-maids
in Elder Days, in years of yore.

But on him mighty doom was laid,
till Moon should fade, an orbed star
to pass, and tarry never more
on Hither Shores where mortals are;

Or ever still a herald on
an errand that should never rest
to bear his shining lamp afar,
the Flammifer of Westernesse.
