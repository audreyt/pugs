Joanna, All

Thanks. I got the following response from Fred Tydeman.

C99 Defect Report (DR) 240 covers this.  The main body of C99
(7.12.9.7) says range error, while Annex F (F.9.6.7 and F.9.6.5)
says "invalid" (domain error).  The result was to change 7.12.9.7
to allow for either range or domain error.  The preferred error
is domain error (so as match Annex F).  So, no need to change XBD.

regards
Andrew
