=pod

This file was derived from failing tests in t/rules/from_perl6_rules/subrule.t.
They work with external parrot, but not with embedded parrot.
(As of r6222, on linux FC3 amd64).

Be careful editing this pod.  It's contents can make the test not fail. :(

The test succeeds if the cap or mumble rules are commented out.
In cap, abcnot and alsoabc fail, but with a different name, and with
many versions of this sentence here, it doesnt.  alsonotabc doesnt.
