Dealing with files and file systems


    Files
     
        my $fh = open "filename", :r err die "Could not open file $!";

        my $row = =$fh;                           # reading a line

    Directories
        my $dh = opendir "dirname" err die "Could not open directory $!";

        my @files = readdir($dh);
        my @files = $dh.readdir;
        
        for $dh.readdir -> $entry {     # read them one-by-one
            say $entry;
        }

        closedir($dh);
        $dh.closedir;

        rewinddir($dh);                  # start from the beginning
        $dh.rewinddir;
