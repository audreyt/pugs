The files in this directory (and any sub-directoris) from the website
http://feather.perl6.nl and are automatically sync'd by the feather
server. So any updates committed here will be applied in 5 minutes or so.

Please don't create file or subdirectory named 'syn' in this directory,
or you will break the smartlinks.pl script running on feather.

http://feather.perl6.nl/syn is actually a symbolic link pointing to
~agentzh/syn on feather. If you do want to debug the synopses
generation process, please run the following command on feather:

   $ ~agentzh/update

If you have further problems, please ask on #perl6. Thank you.
