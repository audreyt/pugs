== TO DO list for the MetaModel

* Create a Perl6::Method::Params to handle formal parameters, and their binding.
* Create a Perl6::SubMethod and add a hash of submethods to the 
  Perl6::MetaClass structure.
* Try to clean up the cut-n-paste of the Class/Instance methods & attributes in
  the Perl6::MetaClass.

* Turn Roles into a more formal MetaRole object.
** Store method conflicts so we can still call them when disambiguating.
** Store attribute conflicts as well
