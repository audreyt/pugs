 Pod::Event::Parser v0.0.2
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a very basic POD parser using an event based API (modeled 
after XML SAX parsers). My goal is to have a working POD parser for 
Pugs which can parse the Perl 6 Synposis POD documents. 

Not the greatest reason in the world, but thats about all I have 
for now :)

And of course the act of writing this will hopefully produce a number
of tests for specific features as well (already is has produced a few).

Oh, and as to why a event based parser. For one, Pugs does not 
(yet) have support for the objects & complex data structures that other
kinds of parser require. Also, since all that kind of stuff gets pushed 
onto the eventhandling portion, it really allows for the simple building of 
arbitrarily complex structures at a later date without having to 
re-write the parser itself, while still allowing for simpler techniques
here in the Perl 6 Stone-Age. Oh yeah, and they are kinda fun too.
