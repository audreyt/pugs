OUTSTANDING PROBLEMS

It is broken by now... migration to P::C::R is incomplete.
You can help just by making it work again...

Grammar/Perl6.pm is hand-manipulated by now...

The problem is in the rule's closures... the capture is not ok.

THE REAL MISSION IS TO SELF-HOST LREP

Already in Perl 6:
./lrep.p6
./Grammar/Perl6.p6
./Grammar/Perl6Primitives.p6

Still in Perl 5:
Rule Closures in ./Grammar/Perl6.p6 are just filtered, not compiled
Grammar/Perl6Init.pm
./Emitter/Perl5.pm
P::C::R must be translated also

TECHNICAL DEBT

* Refactor rules to represent better the reality (see Grammar_Model.txt)
