<h1>"Perl 6 Myths"</h1><br>
Version: 2 (8<sup>th</sup> German Perl Workshop, 2006)<br>
Speaker: Juerd<br>
Duration: any(5..10) minutes<br><br>
<i>This talk is about Perl 6, not about Parrot.</i>
</div>

<div>
<h1>Perl 6 is an April fools joke</h1>
No, that is Parrot.
</div>

<div>
<h1>String concat will be underscore</h1>
No, it will be tilde.
</div>

<div>
<h1>Perl 6 is backwards compatible</h1>
No. Parrot can handle Perl 5, but Perl 6 itself is a new language. There will
perhaps be a conversion script.
</div>

<div>
<h1>Perl 5 is good enough</h1>
Perl 5 has slow subs, unreadable internals, and no formal specification.
Threading in Perl 5 is a problem.
</div>

<div>
<h1>Perl 6 development is closed and secret</h1>
Almost everything happens in public mailing lists. You can join today and hack
away at Parrot, Pugs, and the many subprojects. 
</div>

<div>
<h1>Perl 6 is harder than Perl 5</h1>
There is more to learn, but it will not get harder. Consistency (less
exceptions!) and new ground breaking features make things easier. The end
result, I think, is balanced.
</div>

<div>
<h1>Perl 6 is slower</h1>
Whoever says this, is lying or paranormally gifted...
<br><br>
Or... basing his claim on the current state of Parrot or Pugs, which are nice
software but not quite ready for production, and no indication of the final
product's performance.
</div>

<div>
<h1>CPAN-modules lose their value</h1>
Through PONIE, many Perl 5 modules will be usable in Parrot, and many popular
modules will probably be rewritten.
<br><br>
And of course we get modules for free from languages that switch to Parrot.
</div>

<div>
<h1>There are 0 lines of code in Perl 6</h1>
Simply not true. If modern programming is test based, then our 35_000+ lines of
Perl 6 tests (obviously, written in Perl 6), are a very good head start. Also,
while maybe no lines of Pugs will be in the final implementation, the knowledge
gained will.
<br><br>
Who measures in LoC, anyway? 
</div>

<div>
<h1>Perl 6 depends on Parrot</h1>
Even though The Plan prescribes that Perl 6 will run on Parrot, and that Parrot
is written primarily for Perl 6, we <i>can</i> have Perl 6 without Parrot. In
fact, Pugs already does support multiple backends, like Javascript, PIR
(Parrot), its own evaluator, and... Perl 5's vm.
</div>

<div>
<h1>The rest of the world makes the standard</h1>
Other languages often have good features, and we should steal them. However,
the dot is not stolen because other languages use it. It is stolen because
other languages use it and <i>it is better</i>. It saves two keystrokes (67%),
one character (50%), and visual clutter.
</div>

<div>
<h1>The dot makes it Java-like</h1>
That's up to the users. I think we can make it Ruby-like, python-like, or Perl
6-like instead of Java-like. <br><br>
Don't worry, we won't have
<tt>system().foo().bar().i().value()<br>.please().increment();</tt><br><br>
<tt>$i++</tt> will still be there.
</div>

<div>
<h1>Obfuscation and golf will die</h1>
Perl 6 has many new ways to obfuscate and shorten code. There's less
flexibility in where you can put whitespace, so putting it in nice drawings
becomes harder, but you get hyperoperators, junctions, and twigils to
compensate. If you want to write unreadable, ugly code, you still can!
</div>

<div>
<h1>It'll take <i>years</i> until we have Perl 6</h1>
Perl 6 is already around, and you can play with it as much as you like. There's
even an implementation, even though that isn't necessary the final official
thing. Perhaps it will indeed take a few more years before Perl 6 is ready for
production, but it will be released <i>when it's ready</i>.<br><br>
If you want to help make it ready, please contribute!
</div>

<div>
<h1>It's hard to contribute</h1>
We try to make it easy. Committer bits are given out to everyone who wants
them, there is a shared development machine you can get free access to, there
are open mailinglists, there are IRC channels.<br><br>
If you find it hard to contribute, that says something about you, not about
Perl 6, IMnsHO.
</div>

<div>
<h1>Perl 6 is not Perl</h1>
It depends on your definition of Perl. You should consider basing your
definition of Perl on Larry Wall's definition of Perl, which obviously includes
Perl 6. 

TODO: My Perl 5 knowledge will be useless.
