The Perl 6 Language
Reading Entire Files
Reading in an entire file is now as
simple as
Or to get an array with an element for
each line in the file
Reads the whole file in one go – very
handy, but be careful when dealing with
big files!
my $file_content = slurp("filename.txt");
my @lines = slurp("filename.txt");
