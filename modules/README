= Pugs Modules Directory
===============================================================================

- What is this directory?

This directory is meant to be a temporary holding place for both perl6 module 
ports of perl5 modules, and any new perl6 modules people might want to write.
Eventually all that you see here will end up either on CPAN or the new FreePAN
(see this link for more information http://pugs.kwiki.org/?FreepanProposal).

- Do any of these modules work in Pugs?

No. At this point, none of these modules are expected to work with the current 
state of Pugs. All working modules (or close to working) are contained in the
ext/ directory.

- What is this good for then?

It is our hope that having a number of modules, each with their own test suites, 
will later serve as a kind of integration test for the more advanced features 
of Pugs. 

Also the act of porting perl5 modules helps to raise questions about how certain
things will be accomplished in perl6 and helps to expose some of the darker 
corners of the perl6 spec. Which is a good way to help the perl6-language group
in the development of the spec.

- How can I contribute?

Pick a module, port it, ask for a commiter-bit, and upload it. 

- What modules should I port?

Whatever you like. There are no restrictions nor expectations.

- Is there a How-To document for porting to perl6?

Yes, see modules/PORTING_HOWTO.
