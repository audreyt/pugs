The Perl 6 Language
Cross Operators
Forms every possible permutation of
two or more lists
This is a special case; can stick an
operator in-between two Xs
(1,2) X (3,4) # ((1,3),(1,4),(2,3),(2,4))
# If @user_facts contains words relating to
# a user, can concatenate all possible
# combinations of them together – test for
# weak passwords. :-)
my @guesses = @user_facts X~X @user_facts;
