ANNOUNCE - kp6

kp6 is a Perl6 compiler written in Perl6.

The code is at the Pugs repository, in the v6/v6-KindaPerl6/ directory.
The FAQ is at v6/v6-KindaPerl6/docs/FAQ.pod

v6-KindaPerl6 (kp6) is a reimplementation of mp6(*), with a very flexible compiler workflow.
kp6 uses plugins in order to implement perl6 semantics over several backends.

kp6 implements all mp6 features, plus:

- lexical subroutines
- object metamodel 
- begin-blocks
- containers

The kp6 project will still be active for one month or so, in order to do further bugfixing and optimization. 
After that, this project will be frozen, and a project for a more powerful 'Perl6-on-Perl6' will be started.

(*) v6-MiniPerl6 (mp6) is a bootstrapped compiler, which implements a subset of Perl 6.
