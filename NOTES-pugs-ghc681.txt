NOTES Pugs and GHC-6.8.1

- I needed to do sudo runhaskell Setup.lhs install for HsSyck, hsregex and Pugs
- The most important changes are in the .cabal files due to the refactoring of the base package. 
- Cabal is unhappy about LICENSE being a folder, so I renamed the folder to
  LICENSES and added a file LICENSE.txt that points to it.
- The new bytestring API also required some changes
- Most issues were with scoping of "wobbly types", so the fixes are almost all added type annotations
- I had an issue with libreadline, but that is probably OS X specific. I added
  "-L/usr/local/lib","-lreadline" to the ghc build command (in Makefile.PL) to fix it.
- I needed to do sudo runhaskell Setup.lhs install for HsSyck, hsregex and Pugs
- {-# INCLUDE -} now seems to require and absolute path, at least I had make
  the path to dist/build/Pugs/Embed/Parrot_hsc.h in
  dist/build/Pugs/Embed/Parrot.hs absolute.
