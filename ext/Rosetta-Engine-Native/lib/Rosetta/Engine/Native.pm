Linking Rosetta statically or dynamically with other components is making a

of Rosetta give you permission to link Rosetta with other free software

such a system following the terms of the GPL for Rosetta and the licenses
of the other components concerned, provided that you include the source
code of the other components when and as the GPL requires distribution of
source code.  However, for an additional fee, the copyright holders of
Rosetta can sell you an alternate, limited license that allows you to link
Rosetta with non-free software components.

that you are willing to distribute, because that is a practical way of
suggesting improvements to the standard version.
