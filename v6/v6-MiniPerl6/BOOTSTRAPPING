- Reduce the amount of nodes required to compile MP6::Grammar::Regex
- Implement the Rul::* nodes using MP6, emit MP6 - that would amount to about 5 or 6 nodes

- Implement the required syntax in MP6::Emitter, such that it can emit Perl 5
- Check that the emitted code can compile MP6::Grammar::Regex

- Check that all MP6 files compile and run properly
- Recompile it several times using itself, in order to check the stability of the Bootstrap

- Freeze the project, because it can be useful to bootstrap other VMs
