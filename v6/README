'v6' is a Perl 6 compiler written in plain-perl6.

This is not the perl5 v6-alpha, see perl5/Pugs-Compiler-Perl6 for that.

There are 3 subprojects:

v6.pm is a plain translation of the perl5 v6.pm compiler, such that the modules could be interchangeable.

v6-Compiler is meant as a more advanced compiler, but it is also more difficult to bootstrap because it needs a more complete Perl 6 compiler.

v6-MiniPerl6 is a subset of Perl 6 used to bootstrap the full Perl 6.

v6-Python is a compiler for MiniPerl6 in Python.
