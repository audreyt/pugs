# P60 (**) Construct height-balanced binary trees with a given number of nodes
# 
# Consider a height-balanced binary tree of height H. What is the maximum number
# of nodes it can contain?  Clearly, MaxN = 2**H - 1. However, what is the
# minimum number MinN? This question is more difficult. Try to find a recursive
# statement and turn it into a predicate minNodes/2 defined as follwos:
# 
# % minNodes(H,N) :- N is the minimum number of nodes in a height-balanced binary
# tree of height H.
# 
# (integer,integer), (+,?)
# 
# On the other hand, we might ask: what is the maximum height H a height-balanced
# binary tree with N nodes can have?
# 
# % maxHeight(N,H) :- H is the maximum height of a height-balanced binary tree with N nodes
# (integer,integer), (+,?)
# 
# Now, we can attack the main problem: construct all the height-balanced binary
# trees with a given nuber of nodes.
# 
# % hbal-tree-nodes(N,T) :- T is a height-balanced binary tree with N nodes.
# 
# Find out how many height-balanced trees exist for N = 15.
