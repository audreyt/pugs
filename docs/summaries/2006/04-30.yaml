        summary: |-
          In early April, "Larry" suggested replacing $ with the Euro symbol.  Darren
          Duncan pointed out that $ is used in several countries, and not just in the
          US and proposed using the gold standard of 'Au' to prefix variable names.
          The thread continued with further April Fool's day silliness, ending with
          Yuval Kogman noting that if Larry had participated in the keysigning party
          at OSDC this joke wouldn't have been possible.

          of the difficulties in using characters outside of Latin-1 Unicode.

          of consider this question, although not for Sets defined by rule.
          Discussion continued, with others joining in.

          example, which involved grep, already had this functionality, and Yuval
          asked if this was also true for other functions.

          Herbert Breunung wrote that in the Perl 6 book there was 'Integer context'
          and 'Numeric context' but that he had not noted 'Integer context' in the
          synopses.  He wondered if the concept had been discarded.  Larry Wall
          clarified that it still exists.

        summary: |-
          In <rt://perl/32642>, Bernhard Schmalhofer noted that 
          Perl* PMCs are no longer used in the Parrot core.  He asked if it
          was possible to rename or move the PMCs.  Several people agreed,
          but it was pointed out by Patrick R. Michaud that Chip Salzenberg
          did not want Parrot to change significantly until 1.0.

          strings are assumed to be ASCII unless prefixed by a charset identifier

          Parrot automatically used \u or \x in double-quotes to generate an
          identifier.  Nick Clark said that he felt the reason for the ASCII
          assumption was to avoid the ambiguity that comes from assuming the
          identifier.  There was further discussion, and in the end Patrick
          withdrew his request.
