# P56 (**) Symmetric binary trees
# 
# Let us call a binary tree symmetric if you can draw a vertical line through the
# root node and then the right subtree is the mirror image of the left subtree.
# Write a predicate symmetric/1 to check whether a given binary tree is
# symmetric. Hint: Write a predicate mirror/2 first to check whether one tree is
# the mirror image of another. We are only interested in the structure, not in
# the contents of the nodes.
